thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place. Community members have expressed concerns over this, and have proposed moving back the decay date to a later date and to reimburse the decayed tokens.\n\nPLAN OF ACTION\n\nWe delay the start of the Rektdrop decay to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022.\n\nSignal commitment to reimburse anyone who experienced decay on their airdrop before the newly set date of Monday August 1st, 2022 . These tokens will be reimbursed from the community pool at a later date after all the data is gathered and verified.\n\nWe fast track this proposal on chain if there are no concerns or red flags from the community to limit the amount of decay users experience and make step 2 simpler.\n\nThis will not only ensure users don't experience decay at no fault of their own, but also give more time for new users to claim this airdrop to promote healthy token distribution for Evmos.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe push back the Rektdropt decay date to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022 @ approximately 09:00 UTC. We signal agreement that any user who experienced decay before the newly set decay date should have those tokens reimbursed by the community pool at a later time after we gather the proper info and come up with the plan to send these funds back.\n\nConsidering the start of decay being less than the socially agreed 3 days for a commonwealth discussion, we may fast track this proposal on chain to limit the decay for users if there is no opposition from community members.\n\nI will update the thread with relevant information and decisions as the discussion matures and it is needed.

all,\n\nI want to start a discussion on enabling the inflation module on Evmos Mainnet.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted.\n\nAfter the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\nensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n\ngive more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling the inflation module would mean, that\n\nstaking rewards,\n\nusage incentives and\n\ncommunity pool allocation\n\nare enabled.\n\nTesting on Testnet\n\nWith proposal 28 the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\nstaking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n\ninteracting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts.

post is somewhat related to and goes some way towards addressing the concerns brought up in this post.\n\nAssuming an average 6.5s block time on mainnet (evmos_9001-2), active validators can get away with only signing half of the blocks in a ~54 hour window without being slashed. In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\n\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\n\nSignedBlocksWindow : change from \"30000\" to \"10000\".\n\nMinSignedPerWindow : change from \"0.500000000000000000\" to \"0.050000000000000000\"\n\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.

In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\\\\n\\\\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"SignedBlocksWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"30000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"10000\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"MinSignedPerWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"0.500000000000000000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"0.050000000000000000\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.

Once the proposal passes (i.e is Approved by governance), the ERC20 module uses a factory pattern to deploy an ERC20 token contract representation of the Cosmos (ATOM) Coin. More info regarding x/erc20 module [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tree/main/x/erc20/spec)\n\n**3 main benefits for doing so:**\n1. users will be able to swap Evmos with ATOM on Evmos itself (giving ATOM access to DeFi protocols, NFT)\n2. build new applications that are based on ERC-20 smart contracts and have access to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n3. AAVE will be deployed on Evmos and ATOM is an initial supported asset [more here](https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-aave-v3-on-evmos/7149)\n\n\n**Recap**\n- We are primarily guided by the following naming convention [assetlist](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/assetlists/blob/main/osmosis-1/osmosis-1.assetlist.json#L50-L65)\n- We shouldn't specify a channel number to the symbol ```\n{NAME}\n``` on the first coin registration.

Once the proposal passes (i.e is Approved by governance), the ERC20 module uses a factory pattern to deploy an ERC20 token contract representation of the Cosmos (ATOM) Coin.

RegisterERC20 Proposal: USDC, wETH (Testnet)\n\n**Author:**\n\nConner Swann ([@yourbuddyconner](https://twitter.com/yourbuddyconner)), Nomad Core Team\n\n  \n\n**Context:**\n\nThe Nomad Team would like to start a discussion about the merits of whitelisting Nomad Assets for conversion to Native Cosmos coins. This proposal thread corresponds to two on-chain Testnet proposals: \n\n- RegisterERC20 (Goerli USDC): https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/31\n- RegisterERC20 (Goerli wETH): #TODO\n\n**About Nomad:**\n\n[**Nomad**](https://nomad.xyz) is building interoperability solutions for the cross-chain future. Leveraging an optimistic mechanism, the **Nomad Core** protocol facilitates message-passing between sovereign blockchains, and requires only one honest actor to prevent fraud.

Community Pool Spend: Recover IBC tokens from Airdrop\n​\n## Author\n​\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n​\n## Motivation\n​\nEvmos’ [Rektdrop](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) pioneered a new model for distributing tokens. As announced on the [Evmos dashboard](https://app.evmos.org/mission-control), the Rektdrop ended on Block [5074187](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/5074187) (30 September 2022 at 16:06:40 UTC) and clawed back of all unclaimed tokens, returning them to the Evmos Community Pool.\n\nDuring this process, the [IBC module account](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x) was falsely targeted for clawback and transferred all EVMOS tokens from the IBC module account to the Evmos Community Pool. At the time of the clawback, this account held a balance of ~3.2 million EVMOS tokens (3167501226339726493675414aevmos). \n\nTo remediate this unexpected transfer of funds, we propose to return the funds from the Evmos Community Pool back to the IBC module account with this proposal. Note that we are simply withdrawing the amount from the Community Pool that could affect users and not the entire amount in the Community Pool.\n​\n## Impact\n​\nThe EVMOS tokens on the IBC module account represent the total amount of EVMOS tokens that have been sent to other chains over IBC. Users may currently be encountering an inability to transfer their EVMOS balances on these other chains back to Evmos. This is because there is an insufficient balance on the IBC module account. The Community Pool Spend outlined in this proposal would restore the balance on the IBC module account, enabling users to once again transfer up to their entire balance of EVMOS tokens from other Comsmos chains back to the Evmos chain via IBC.\n\nThe bug also falsely targeted some additional user accounts during the clawback. This means that some users' funds were accidentally clawed back to the Community Pool as well. We’ve moved quickly to identify the wallets affected and amounts that each are owed. We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \n\n## Requested amount\n\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\n\nBefore clawback:\n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\nbalances:\n- amount: \"3167501226339726493675414\"\n  denom: aevmos\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nAfter clawback: \n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\nbalances:\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nThe entire EVMOS balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \n\n## Learnings\n\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

As announced on the [Evmos dashboard](https://app.evmos.org/mission-control), the Rektdrop ended on Block [5074187](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/5074187) (30 September 2022 at 16:06:40 UTC) and clawed back of all unclaimed tokens, returning them to the Evmos Community Pool.\\n​\\nDuring this process, the [IBC module account](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x) was falsely targeted for clawback and transferred all $EVMOS tokens from the IBC module account to the Evmos Community Pool. At the time of the clawback, this account held a balance of ~3.2 million EVMOS tokens (3167501226339726493675414aevmos). \\n​\\nTo remediate this unexpected transfer of funds, we propose to return the funds from the Evmos Community Pool back to the IBC module account with this proposal. Note that we are simply withdrawing the amount from the Community Pool that could affect users and not the entire amount in the Community Pool.\\n​\\n## Impact\\n​\\nThe EVMOS tokens on the IBC module account represent the total amount of EVMOS tokens, that have been sent to other chains over IBC. If there is insufficient balance on this account, users cannot return their EVMOS to the Evmos chain using IBC. The Community Pool Spend outlined in this proposal would regain the balance on the IBC module account and allow users again to transfer all their EVMOS tokens from other Comsmos chains back to the Evmos chain via IBC.\\n​\\nThe bug also resulted in falsely targeting some additional user accounts during the clawback. This means that some users' funds were accidentally clawed back to the Community Pool as well. We’ve moved quickly to identify the wallets affected and amounts that each are owed. We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \\n​\\n## Requested amount\\n​\\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\\n​\\nBefore clawback:\\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"3167501226339726493675414\\\"\\n  denom: aevmos\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nAfer clawback: \\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nThe entire Emvos balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \\n​\\n## Learnings\\n​\\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n\n**ChainHub & Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community and, post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\n\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is the faculty sponsor and founding faculty advisor of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\n\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n\n#### OUR EXPERIENCE\n\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\n\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately\n# 1\n two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n\n#### SUMMARY OF TERMS\n\n1. ChainHub will:\n  1. Incubate approximately two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n  2. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community ChainHub (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\n\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n\n#### BUDGET REQUEST\n\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\n\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\n1. The first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (285714 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (142857 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3. The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (142857 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 625K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 100K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 125K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\n\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 2 Web3 + backend engineers, 1 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe tokens will be staked and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. When exhausted, we will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 50K a month in conversion to USD.\n\nA multisig will be set up to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\n#### PROPOSED PROJECTS\n\n **EvLend**\n\nProject Specs: [https://sierra-fi.gitbook.io/evlend/](https://sierra-fi.gitbook.io/evlend/)\n\nEvLend aims to be the most efficient variable rate borrow-lend market on Evmos.\n\nEvLend uses reactive interest rate technology to target specific utilization rates (% of funds in the money market being borrowed) for stablecoin assets while still providing support for borrow & lend services to other assets.\n\nReactive interest rates are a more recent innovation popularized by Euler finance. EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.\n\nEvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.\n\nMore information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.\n\n**Evmos Bridge**\n\nProject Specs: [https://crest-protocol.gitbook.io/evmos-bridge-specs/](https://crest-protocol.gitbook.io/evmos-bridge-specs/)\n\nWe propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning.

all,\n\nThis is a follow up to Proposal 39 to introduce Evmos external incentives in Osmosis, Pool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO) . The original Commonwealth discussion can be found HERE .\n\nBackground\n\nWe have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M! The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th , so the community needs to decide the next steps forward!\n\n(image)\n\nQuestions\n\n#1) Does the community wish to extend the Osmosis External Incentives?\n\n#2) If so, how many tokens? For how many days?\n\nProposal\n\nUPDATE OCT 4th 2022\n\nBased on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, seems like the preferred path forward is another 600k EVMOS over 90 days . Osmosis is the gateway for new users into the Cosmos ecosystem so it is important to maintain deep liquidity. Once this period is over, we can reevaluate the incentives as we will have a clearer picture with how native liquidity has grown.\n\n600k EVMOS over a 90 day period (6,666.67 EVMOS per day), 100 EVMOS for funding Osmosis gauge creation and filling. (Updated Oct. 8th)\n\nTOTAL : 600,100 EVMOS\n\n14 day bond only\n\nPool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\n\nMULTISIG (3/4)\n\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\n\nbennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n\n@Tricky | Cosmos Spaces  - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nLPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nJohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs\n\nTimeline\n\nA proposal would need to be on-chain no later than October 10th and subsequently passed to allow for enough time to refill the gauge and have no disruption in external incentive rewards.\n\n-benny","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-28T18:41:43.095Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1u0qpyh04ufyyt6q0vqj7pjwk6k0j2mjm353zsj\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"benny lava\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/99601250-a20e-4a64-a2e0-c3af708abac9.jpg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-09-26T14:27:12.558Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Hi all,\\\\n\\\\nThis is a follow up to \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/39\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 39\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" to introduce Evmos external incentives in Osmosis, \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/722\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Pool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".

- Start Liquidity Mining Campaign for Gravity, Celer, and Axelar assets\n\nThis proposal has been posted to IPFS with the hash: QmXKzWgYjB9hhNpC5CTqdfRAXBg4e7ddPEdaBXDc7iE13v\n\nHi Evmos Community!\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to bring stablecoin liquidity back to Evmos. In the past, Kinesis Labs has reached over 459k USD worth of stablecoins in TVL without any incentives, with over 11,000 transactions and 400 unique liquidity providers. All of this was organic liquidity from the Evmos community, there were no funds or deals done to bootstrap this liquidity.\n\nHowever, with the recent nomad hack, both Kinesis and Evmos need a way to bootstrap liquidity to jump start the Evmos DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoin liquidity is important to any ecosystem for a few reasons. Firstly, we want to keep value on Evmos. If there is no native stablecoin on Evmos, users wishing to store their value in a stable unit of account will need to bridge back to a chain with stablecoins, thus draining liquidity from the Evmos Ecosystem. Secondly, native deep stablecoin liquidity is important in allowing new stablecoins to grow in Evmos. This has been the main use case of Curve on Ethereum, allowing stablecoins such as DAI, FRAX, and Synthetix USD to remain pegged to the USD dollar. By increasing the amount of stablecoin liquidity new stablecoins can trade against, these new stablecoins get a more robust peg.\n\nWe propose the following plan to bring stablecoin liquidity back to Evmos:\n\n50k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar USDC, Celer USDC, Gravity USDC pool\n\n30k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar USDT, Celer USDT, Gravity USDT pool\n\n19k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar DAI, Celer DAI, Gravity DAI pool\n\nWe are requesting a total of 99k Evmos for this proposal to be linearly distributed over 2 months. Please note that this is different from the temperature pool composition. We have heard your feedback and sacrificed a bit of security for better user experience.\n\nAll of these funds will be distributed to liquidity providers on Kinesis through the minichef contract, no funds will ever reach an EOA or multisig - these funds are not for the Kinesis Team nor the Axelar, Celer, or Gravity teams. Additionally, the only fee on Kinesis is the 0.04% swap fee which goes entirely to LPs, and Kinesis does not currently have a token or any other value extraction mechanism. We are building this project as members of the Evmos ecosystem as a public good. The way we are monetizing is by raising the price of Evmos that we are staking.\n\nThe multisig that controls these funds will be a 4 out of 6 consisting of:\nTricky, Cosmos Spaces\nLPX, EvmosDAO\nTlopplot, Evmos DAO\nMo Dong, Co-Founder of Celer Network\nDeborah Simpier, Co-Founder and CEO of Althea (Gravity Bridge)\nGeorgios Vlachos, Co-Founder of Axelar\n\nThis multisig has been deployed at 0x05e1B9A295aDaF39132FC5bF2b0aEd9FE7C42a2C\n\nThe reasoning behind these members is that these would be the key stakeholders for this proposal as they are active community members as well as one representative from each bridge on Evmos.\n\nAdditionally, Celer will match this with a minimum of 1m in Celer stablecoin liquidity, which will be deposited into the Celer stablecoin pools.\n\nWe’ve been working closely with the Axelar Network, Celer Network, Gravity Bridge teams on this initiative. If there’s any questions, the Kinesis + Axelar + Celer + Gravity bridge teams will be happy to answer down below.\n\nBackground on Axelar Network\nSummary:\nAxelar network is built from the ground up using Cosmos SDK to interoperate between Cosmos chains, EVM chains, Bitcoin, and other PoS and PoW chains. Satellite is the cross-chain asset transfer app built on top of the network and has amassed over $37m TVL and 100k cross-chain transactions since launching in February. It has also recently become the official canonical bridge for Osmosis and plans to further expand its reach into the Cosmos and EVM ecosystem.\n\nSatellite currently supports Avalanche, Polygon, Terra, Osmosis, Moonbeam, Fantom, Ethereum and Cosmos Hub with plans to support all major EVM chains over the next couple months. \n\nSatellite connects all Cosmos chains via IBC and its GCP protocol with multiple ecosystems. \nIt’s built on top of Axelar’s “decentralized overlay network” that connects different blockchain stacks. Axelar serves as the translation layer that allows Cosmos assets to flow freely to all Axelar-interconnected networks and back. It is permissionless, meaning that anyone can join, submit transactions, relay, and validate.\n\nAxelar has been audited by Ackeeblockchain, Cure53, NCC, Oak Security, Commonprefix labs and independent researchers and is also dedicating at least 5% of AXL supply to an insurance fund/program that will help recuperate any stolen funds to ensure the safety of its users.\n\nSecurity:\n\nAxelar believes that bridging solutions should be at least as secure as the chains being bridged. Axelar’s solution is having a Cosmos chain, one with a similar validator set to other chains. Additionally, they are heavily invested in securing their smart contracts and in applying cutting-edge cryptography.\n\nThe Axelar network isolates functionalities in modules at the Cosmos SDK level, e.g., one module for bitcoin, another for EVM chains, another for IBC transfers, etc. \n\nEach module handles the respective transactions from source and destination chains and are isolated from each other and messages can only be passed through a router module. If there is an issue with one or all chains, a special transfer command that can be supplied by the governance multisig can pause the router module.\n\nThere is also minimal reliance on smart contracts and are only used for key-rotations and mint/burn operations.\n\nThe mint/burn contracts can also be freezed in case of a compromise and have a rate-limit functionality that allows to minimize how much funds can be stolen in case of an attack. This is not enabled on the mainnet at the moment, but can be considered along with other “access control” policies to minimize attacks. \n\nThere will also be an insurance fund/program of at least 5% of the AXL supply to compensate users in case of stolen funds. Axelar has also been audited by Ackeeblockchain, Cure53, NCC, Oak Security, Commonprefix labs and independent researchers and gone through a dozen audits. \n\nCosts:\n\nAxelar currently has a set fee on each transfer that covers gas costs on source + destination chain. Axelar foundation subsidizes any increase in the destination gas cost if need be and is also considering subsiding fees further from its treasury. \n\nTransactions are also batched, reducing the gas costs for the users significantly. Axelar also has active implementation of threshold signatures that can be used to replace individual validator signatures and further save gas costs. While not currently deployed in EVM contracts, this is just one of the many code-level gas optimizations that Axelar will ship in the future.\n\nUsers only pay the fee in the asset they transfer on the source chain, and all other fees (relaying / intermediary / destination chains) are covered by services around the network. \n\nApp:\nhttps://satellite.axelar.network/\n \nBackground on Celer Network\nSummary:\nCeler Network is a multi-chain operating system built with Cosmos SDK. Celer released the world’s first EVM-supported inter-chain message SDK. and has a track record of no hacks for any product since Celer originated in 2018.\n\nCeler cBridge is a token bridge application built on top of Celer that supports 45 different tokens across 21 different blockchains and layer-2 rollups. cBridge has $400M TVL and has processed more than $4B of cross-chain volume for 105K unique users with a daily volume of $50M-$60M across 21 different blockchains.\n\ncBridge comes with two security models that every user can choose between, the Cosmos-consensus security model and an optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer security model. The consensus model is security that of a validator-based bridge, while the optimistic rollup style also has a delay buffer to allow an independent watchtower service to double check the message.\n\nUsers have single-click UX with fast confirmation of the bridge between source and destination chains and with 2,500-3,500 daily active users comfortable with using Celer Network.\n\n\nSecurity:\n\nCosmos-consensus Security Model:\nCeler SGN is running as a Cosmos chain with the same level of liveness assumption which is very high like other Cosmos chains. Celer provides an L1-blockchain level security like Cosmos or Polygon as a Proof-of-Stake chain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a validator acts maliciously, their CELR will be slashed.\n\nOptimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model:\nInter-chain dApps can maintain full security with an optimistic-style delay buffer. Instead of instantly processing a message through the consensus model, one can inject a mandatory delay buffer and run an independent watchtower service to double-validate the message on the source chain. If the watchtower service detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the delay expires. \n\nFor transactions larger than a certain amount, two-transactions are needed to make the bridge happen: a “commit” transaction that will trigger the time buffer and then after the time buffer, a “confirm” transaction. The watchtower system also monitors the bridge for small transactions as well to detect and prevent any unexpected smart contract bugs. There is also rate-limiting for token bridging as the last-resort to worst-case scenario. \n\nIn addition, Celer cBridge smart contract has been heavily audited and also has a $2M ImmuneFi bug bounty. Celer Network also has a track record since 2018 of no hacking event happening for any product they have built. \n\nCosts:\ncBridge charges the gas fee on the destination chain to cover the operation costs of validators. The fee is not related to the size of the transaction, unlike many other bridging solutions. \n\nCeler also has no plans to change the fee structure and remains committed to supporting inter-chain apps where IBC is not available. Unlike other bridges that plan on changing to percentage-based fees later, Celer will only charge a flat fee based on the size of the message passed to provide revenue for validators.\n\nThere are also no platform fees charged by the Celer Network for token asset bridging.  \n\nApp:\nhttps://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer\nBackground on Gravity Bridge\n\nSummary:\nThe Gravity Bridge blockchain is the trustless, neutral bridge between Ethereum and the Cosmos ecosystem. The principal focus of the Gravity community is on providing the most effective and secure bridge possible, instead of a DeFi application on the local chain. \n\nGravity Bridge protocol focuses on creating a simple bridge design that focuses on providing better security by eliminating design complexity and using non-upgradeable contracts which have been audited by Certick, Least Authority and Cod4rena. \n\nThe Gravity Bridge protocol provides strong censorship resistance guarantees and the bridge will remain live as long as the chain remains live, i.e. with more than 2/3 of validators active. \n\nCurrently supports Ethereum and has plans to support additional EVM chains before the end of 2022. \n\nWhile there is not currently a set-aside for an insurance fund, one could easily be set aside from the community pool which contains 50% of $GRAV token distribution which could also contain a collection of assets. \n\nSecurity:\n\nGravity Bridge is trustless, decentralized and highly efficient and offers the closest approximation of IBC security possible. It is highly decentralized with all funds directly controlled by validators with slashing to deter validators from acting in bad faith.\n\nThe Gravity Bridge design means that the only way to attack the bridge is to go through the validators themselves. This results in a trustless bridge that costs less to operate than a custodial one. It is not possible for a validator to avoid signing a specific transaction or for a relayer to avoid relaying it. Anyone can submit evidence of a signature over a non-protocol message to slash a validator which makes it extremely difficult for validators to steal funds.\n\nThe Gravity Bridge, like all bridges, has two components. A Solidity contract on Ethereum and a CosmosSDK module on the Gravity Bridge blockchain.\n\nThe solidity contract that holds funds on Ethereum is merely 580 lines of code, which makes it compact and easy to review. It has been audited by three independent teams (Certik, Least Authority, and Code4rena), and it is not upgradable. It requires no trusted parties and can be temporarily paused by governance vote in case of a possible security breach. As a final layer of protection the Gravity Bridge blockchain performs a series of integrity checks that will halt the chain on any unexpected behavior.\n\nWhile there’s nothing set for an insurance fund at the moment, the $GRAV token holders can choose to use some funds from the large community pool to help recuperate stolen funds. \n\nCosts:\n\nRobust relaying reward systems combined with reduced gas costs creates extremely fast & reliable transfers with a decentralized, self-funded, relayer community\n\nGravity Bridge batches withdraw transactions. This works like a rollup on Ethereum. Executing many transactions in a single shared context is far more efficient than doing so individually. This process provides huge efficiency gains, up to 96% reduction in gas cost.\n\nOnce bridge traffic has matured, tx fees could be enabled by the community to sustain the community pool. These tx fees are payable in a wide variety of tokens, not solely in GRAV. Other mechanisms, like a portion of the inflation, could be used to fund the community pool. \n\nApp:\nhttps://spacestation.zone/\n\nBackground on Kinesis\nAbout Kinesis:\nKinesis is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) on the EVMOS blockchain, optimized for trading pegged value crypto assets with minimal slippage such as stablecoins. Through Kinesis, all traders can swap their desired stablecoins between EVM compatible blockchains and Cosmos chains.\n\nKinesis enables efficient, swift, and low-slippage swaps for traders and high-yield for liquidity providers. We believe in collaboration with other Cosmos projects, in maximizing the interoperability of Kinesis, and in building out the stablecoin ecosystem for Cosmos.\n\nKinesis has no governance token, no admin fees, and no value extraction mechanism. We are building this project as members of the Evmos ecosystem as a public good.\n\nTransaction Data\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"Liquidity Mining Proposal for Axelar Network, Celer Network, and Gravity Bridge on Kinesis\",\n  \"description\": \"Link to Proposal: [IPFS link will be inserted here] \",\n  \"recipient\": \"0x05e1B9A295aDaF39132FC5bF2b0aEd9FE7C42a2C\",\n  \"amount\": [\n    {\n      \"denom\": \"aevmos\",\n      \"amount\": \"99000000000000000000000\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"deposit\": \"64000000000000000000aevmos\"\n}\n\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-20T01:58:34.051Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1wz6aj023n3f2qzpelm2ls7286j7g9mmd2lw6ca\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Kinesis Labs\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"https://kinesislabs.co/\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"The Premier Destination for Stablecoins on Cosmos.

In the past, Kinesis Labs has reached over 459k USD worth of stablecoins in TVL without any incentives, with over 11,000 transactions and 400 unique liquidity providers. All of this was organic liquidity from the Evmos community, there were no funds or deals done to bootstrap this liquidity.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, with the recent nomad hack, both Kinesis and Evmos need a way to bootstrap liquidity to jump start the Evmos DeFi ecosystem. Stablecoin liquidity is important to any ecosystem for a few reasons. Firstly, we want to keep value on Evmos. If there is no native stablecoin on Evmos, users wishing to store their value in a stable unit of account will need to bridge back to a chain with stablecoins, thus draining liquidity from the Evmos Ecosystem. Secondly, native deep stablecoin liquidity is important in allowing new stablecoins to grow in Evmos. This has been the main use case of Curve on Ethereum, allowing stablecoins such as DAI, FRAX, and Synthetix USD to remain pegged to the USD dollar. By increasing the amount of stablecoin liquidity new stablecoins can trade against, these new stablecoins get a more robust peg.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We propose the following plan to bring stablecoin liquidity back to Evmos:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"50k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar USDC, Celer USDC, Gravity USDC pool\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"30k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar USDT, Celer USDT, Gravity USDT pool\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"19k Evmos tokens to be distributed to the Axelar DAI, Celer DAI, Gravity DAI pool\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWe are requesting a total of \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"99k Evmos for this proposal to be linearly distributed over 2 months\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".

If there’s any questions, the Kinesis + Axelar + Celer + Gravity bridge teams will be happy to answer down below.\\\\n\\\\nBackground on Axelar Network\\\\nSummary:\\\\nAxelar network is built from the ground up using Cosmos SDK to interoperate between Cosmos chains, EVM chains, Bitcoin, and other PoS and PoW chains. Satellite is the cross-chain asset transfer app built on top of the network and has amassed over $37m TVL and 100k cross-chain transactions since launching in February. It has also recently become the official canonical bridge for Osmosis and plans to further expand its reach into the Cosmos and EVM ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nSatellite currently supports Avalanche, Polygon, Terra, Osmosis, Moonbeam, Fantom, Ethereum and Cosmos Hub with plans to support all major EVM chains over the next couple months. \\\\n\\\\nSatellite connects all Cosmos chains via IBC and its GCP protocol with multiple ecosystems. \\\\nIt’s built on top of Axelar’s “decentralized overlay network” that connects different blockchain stacks. Axelar serves as the translation layer that allows Cosmos assets to flow freely to all Axelar-interconnected networks and back. It is permissionless, meaning that anyone can join, submit transactions, relay, and validate.\\\\n\\\\nAxelar has been audited by Ackeeblockchain, Cure53, NCC, Oak Security, Commonprefix labs and independent researchers and is also dedicating at least 5% of AXL supply to an insurance fund/program that will help recuperate any stolen funds to ensure the safety of its users.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity:\\\\n\\\\nAxelar believes that bridging solutions should be at least as secure as the chains being bridged. Axelar’s solution is having a Cosmos chain, one with a similar validator set to other chains. Additionally, they are heavily invested in securing their smart contracts and in applying cutting-edge cryptography.\\\\n\\\\nThe Axelar network isolates functionalities in modules at the Cosmos SDK level, e.g., one module for bitcoin, another for EVM chains, another for IBC transfers, etc. \\\\n\\\\nEach module handles the respective transactions from source and destination chains and are isolated from each other and messages can only be passed through a router module. If there is an issue with one or all chains, a special transfer command that can be supplied by the governance multisig can pause the router module.\\\\n\\\\nThere is also minimal reliance on smart contracts and are only used for key-rotations and mint/burn operations.\\\\n\\\\nThe mint/burn contracts can also be freezed in case of a compromise and have a rate-limit functionality that allows to minimize how much funds can be stolen in case of an attack. This is not enabled on the mainnet at the moment, but can be considered along with other “access control” policies to minimize attacks. \\\\n\\\\nThere will also be an insurance fund/program of at least 5% of the AXL supply to compensate users in case of stolen funds. Axelar has also been audited by Ackeeblockchain, Cure53, NCC, Oak Security, Commonprefix labs and independent researchers and gone through a dozen audits. \\\\n\\\\nCosts:\\\\n\\\\nAxelar currently has a set fee on each transfer that covers gas costs on source + destination chain. Axelar foundation subsidizes any increase in the destination gas cost if need be and is also considering subsiding fees further from its treasury. \\\\n\\\\nTransactions are also batched, reducing the gas costs for the users significantly. Axelar also has active implementation of threshold signatures that can be used to replace individual validator signatures and further save gas costs. While not currently deployed in EVM contracts, this is just one of the many code-level gas optimizations that Axelar will ship in the future.\\\\n\\\\nUsers only pay the fee in the asset they transfer on the source chain, and all other fees (relaying / intermediary / destination chains) are covered by services around the network. \\\\n\\\\nApp:\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://satellite.axelar.network/\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://satellite.axelar.network/\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n \\\\nBackground on Celer Network\\\\nSummary:\\\\nCeler Network is a multi-chain operating system built with Cosmos SDK. Celer released the world’s first EVM-supported inter-chain message SDK. and has a track record of no hacks for any product since Celer originated in 2018.\\\\n\\\\nCeler cBridge is a token bridge application built on top of Celer that supports 45 different tokens across 21 different blockchains and layer-2 rollups. cBridge has $400M TVL and has processed more than $4B of cross-chain volume for 105K unique users with a daily volume of $50M-$60M across 21 different blockchains.\\\\n\\\\ncBridge comes with two security models that every user can choose between, the Cosmos-consensus security model and an optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer security model. The consensus model is security that of a validator-based bridge, while the optimistic rollup style also has a delay buffer to allow an independent watchtower service to double check the message.\\\\n\\\\nUsers have single-click UX with fast confirmation of the bridge between source and destination chains and with 2,500-3,500 daily active users comfortable with using Celer Network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSecurity:\\\\n\\\\nCosmos-consensus Security Model:\\\\nCeler SGN is running as a Cosmos chain with the same level of liveness assumption which is very high like other Cosmos chains. Celer provides an L1-blockchain level security like Cosmos or Polygon as a Proof-of-Stake chain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a validator acts maliciously, their CELR will be slashed.\\\\n\\\\nOptimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model:\\\\nInter-chain dApps can maintain full security with an optimistic-style delay buffer. Instead of instantly processing a message through the consensus model, one can inject a mandatory delay buffer and run an independent watchtower service to double-validate the message on the source chain. If the watchtower service detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the delay expires. \\\\n\\\\nFor transactions larger than a certain amount, two-transactions are needed to make the bridge happen: a “commit” transaction that will trigger the time buffer and then after the time buffer, a “confirm” transaction.

There is also rate-limiting for token bridging as the last-resort to worst-case scenario. \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, Celer cBridge smart contract has been heavily audited and also has a $2M ImmuneFi bug bounty. Celer Network also has a track record since 2018 of no hacking event happening for any product they have built. \\\\n\\\\nCosts:\\\\ncBridge charges the gas fee on the destination chain to cover the operation costs of validators. The fee is not related to the size of the transaction, unlike many other bridging solutions. \\\\n\\\\nCeler also has no plans to change the fee structure and remains committed to supporting inter-chain apps where IBC is not available. Unlike other bridges that plan on changing to percentage-based fees later, Celer will only charge a flat fee based on the size of the message passed to provide revenue for validators.\\\\n\\\\nThere are also no platform fees charged by the Celer Network for token asset bridging.  \\\\n\\\\nApp:\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nBackground on Gravity Bridge\\\\n\\\\nSummary:\\\\nThe Gravity Bridge blockchain is the trustless, neutral bridge between Ethereum and the Cosmos ecosystem.

We would like to propose a liquid staking solution called rEVMOS (rEVMOS Solution) for Evmos’s native token $EVMOS, based on StaFiHub’s Liquid Staking Solution. \n\nWhat Is The rEVMOS Solution?\n\nrEVMOS solution developed on StaFiHub will help the Evmos community to stake their $EVMOS tokens to earn the staking rewards from the Evmos network, while still enjoying the liquidity of their staked $EVMOS tokens through the voucher token called $rEVMOS.\n\nThe steps for users are very simple:\n1) Stake $EVMOS tokens through StaFiHub;\n2) Receive $rEVMOS tokens which represent your staked assets and attached staking rewards.\n\nWhat Is The $rEVMOS Token?\n\n$rEVMOS token is the staking derivative issued by StaFiHub when users stake their $EVMOS tokens through StaFiHub.\n\n$rEVMOS token has the following features:\nStaking Reward Bearing: The rToken value will increase continuously due to the staking rewards generated.\nTransferable Through IBC: The rToken could be transferred at any time to any IBC chains in the Cosmos Ecosystem.\nTradable: The rToken can be traded on any Cosmos Ecosystem supported DEXes including rDEX (developed by StaFiHub), Osmosis or Crescent. \nRedeemable: The rToken can also be redeemed back to its corresponding native tokens and staking rewards at any time without permission. \n\nWhy Does the Evmos Community Need rEVMOS?\n\nFor $EVMOS token holders:\nGreat Liquidity: There will be no need to worry about liquidity problems caused by the 2 week unbonding period. rEVMOS App users could always trade rEVMOS tokens to gain the liquidity at any time they want.\nEasy to get the maximized staking rewards: There will be no need to learn the Tendermint mechanism any more. Users will only need to follow a few simple steps to stake $EVMOS through StaFiHub, which will automatically select the best validator to delegate based on our profit maximization strategy.\n\nFor The Network Security:\nHigher Staking Ratio: rEVMOS solution will help solve the liquidity of staked assets, thus improving the willingness of the community to stake.\nA higher staking ratio will also result in greater security for the Evmos network.\n\nrEVMOS Solution Design\n\nThe core of the rEVMOS solution design includes the following elements:\n\n1) Staking Pool: A pool is an ICA account or Multi-sig Account of  Evmos to gather rEVMOS user’s staked $EVMOS tokens and invoke staking related calls such as Bond, Unbond and Claim on the Evmos chain to earn more tokens. \n\n2) LiquidityBond: LiquidityBond is the entry point for users to obtain rEVMOS on StaFiHub. Users can submit their transfer voucher to mint $rEVMOS tokens.\n\n3) LiquidityUnbond: LiquidityUnbond is the entry point for users to redeem their $EVMOS tokens on StaFiHub.\n\n4) Exchange Rate of rEVMOS: Exchange Rate of rEVMOS is used to calculate how many rEVMOS tokens to mint for a user's LiquidityBond and how many $EVMOS tokens should be unbonded and transferred back. It is initialized to 1 and will increase gradually along with the generated staking rewards.\n\n5) $rEVMOS Circulation Circle: We have attached the following infographic to explain how the circulation of $rEVMOS tokens under the StaFiHub technical stack works. A visualization of the interactions between $EVMOS staker, StaFiHub, Evmos and other IBC gang chains is presented below.\n\n\n\nrEVMOS Delegation Algorithm\n\nBased on the Tendermint consensus mechanism of Evmos and the influencing factors of staking rewards, the rEVMOS solution adopts the following staking rewards maximization strategy:\n\n1) Diversified delegation: The $EVMOS tokens deposited by the user will be distributed to several(N) mini staking pools. N will be based on the scale of the deposit. Each staking pool will then select several (M) validators for delegation by the profit maximization strategy, so as to reduce the slashing occurrence probability of a single node;\n\n2) Smartly select Original Validator candidates: The rEVMOS solution will evaluate the performance data of original validator candidates from the metrics including online duration, slashing record, self-bond ratio, node identity, commission ratio, etc., to ensure that excellent validators with relatively low commission are selected.\n\n3) An automatic delegation algorithm that maximizes staking rewards: The solution monitors OV’s on-chain data in real-time, such as commission ratio changes, commission volume ranking, slashing, off-line rate, and other indicators. This ensures that the system selects the best OVs for delegation in each Era while simultaneously reinvesting profits.\n\n4) Finding a balance between maximizing staking rewards and Evmos validators’ decentralization: StaFiHub aims to contribute positively to the Evmos’s validator ecosystem to avoid the concentration of validator’s voting power.  \n\nIf you want to know more about the delegation algorithm of StaFiHub liquid staking solutions, you are welcome to refer to StaFiHub Delegation Algorithm.\n\nWhy StaFiHub?\n\nStaFiHub and the StaFi team have extensive knowledge and experiences in the liquid staking industry since the start of 2019. StaFi is one of the earliest projects that have been proposing the liquid staking innovations.\n\nNow StaFi has issued 8 liquid staking derivatives with over 60 million $USD TVL for the top adopted PoS chains like ETH2.0, Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana, etc.\n\nSome achievements:\nStaFi’s rETH liquid staking solution for ETH2.0 is one of the six projects listed on Ethereum Foundation Website 2.\nrETH token is also one of the few ETH staking derivatives listed on Curve.\nTotal TVL hits [100 million] $USD in October 2021.\nStaFi got the grant for rMATIC solutions from Polygon Foundation.\n\nStaFiHub's Unique Features\n\nStaFiHub has the following unique features among all the liquid staking solutions in Cosmos Eco:\n\n1) Support Integrations both in Multisig Account and Interchain Account (ICA) . \nNow only 4 or 5 Cosmos Eco chains are supporting the ICA module, and the rest of the Cosmos Eco chains are still not enabling the ICA module. Some liquid staking projects could only onboard the Cosmos Eco projects which are supporting the ICA. \n\nWhile, StaFiHub will also support the ICA chains and non-ICA chains to have the liquid staking solution at the same time. The non-ICA chains could have StaFiHub's liquid staking solutions in multi-sign account and will be smoothly and safely upgraded into the ICA features when the chains also support ICA in the future.\n\n2) Innovate A Permissionless and Automaitc Delegation Algorithm.\nStaFiHub has innovated a smart delegation algorithm that is impletmented automatically to create maximized stakingr rewards for stakers and decentralized voting power for the projects. \n\nWe have built a smart validator score system to evaluate all the validators on-chain based on their on-chain data like uptime, slash record, and commissions, etc.\n\nThere is no whitelist for validators to get the delegations from the StaFiHub, and it is totally permissionless and open for all on-chain validators.\n\n3) Fast Integration in Less Than One Week.\nStaFiHub could onboard Cosmos Eco projects to have rTokens in a few days.\n\n4) Over 2 years Experiences with no Security Events\nStaFiHub is backed by StaFi team which already has over 2 years experiences in liquidity staking and have issued 8 rTokens with over 100M USD TVL at its peak. StaFi is also one of the 6 staking pools that are recommended on Ethereum Foundation Website:https://ethereum.org/en/staking/pools/\n\n5) Plenty of Mintdrops and Liqudiity Farming Programs \nWe have launched Mintdrop programs to reward the $FIS tokens to the users of StaFiHub and will launch the Liquidity Farming Program soon for the rToken liqudity providers.\n\n\n\nSuggested Grants from Evmos Community\n\nBased on the past experience of the StaFi team, developing the rEVMOS solution is not a difficult task. However, the liquidity of rEVMOS token is crucial for its success. Therefore, the StaFi team will need to work together with the Evmos Community as well as the Evmos Foundation team to make the rEVMOS solution presented a success.\n\nStaFiHub would like to request the following support from the Evmos Community Treasury:\nProvide $10,000.00 USD valued $EVMOS tokens for StaFi Core team as the rEVMOS solution development grant (The Grant) to cover the related technical costs. All $EVMOS tokens received from The Grant will be staked in the rEVMOS App.\nEvmos Community or Evmos Foundation sponsors at least 2% of the total $EVMOS token or 1M $USD valued $EVMOS tokens as the initial liquidity for rEVMOS and EVMOS pair on rDEX, which is an AMM DEX built by StaFi. This support will create a considerable barrier to manipulate the rEVMOS price so that it will not too easy to lose peg against the EVMOS token.\nProvide marketing support for StaFiHub’s rEVMOS solution and its liquidity with the implementation of marketing activities such as videos, tutorials, social media and the like.\n\nStaFiHub’s Work and Co-incentive Plan\n\nWith the above grant from Evmos Community, StaFiHub will:\nDesign and develop the rEVMOS solution which will be deployed on StaFiHub, a Cosmos SDK based chain developed by StaFi.\nRun IBC relayer nodes to support the rEVMOS token transfer between StaFiHub chain and other IBC chains including Evmos chain.\nDeploy a pool for $rEVMOS and $EVMOS trading pair on rDEX, an AMM DEX developed by StaFi and deployed on StaFiHub.\nWork with the Evmos community to provide liquidity farming incentives to bootstrap the liquidity for rEVMOS trading pair on rDEX.\nDevelop additional use cases for rEVMOS token holders such as lending and more DEX support.\nProvide marketing support through the implementation of marketing activities such as videos, tutorials, social media and the like.\nTake part in the marketing efforts and activities with the other projects that are a part of the cohort to amplify marketing efforts.\n\nTimeline and Future Work\nPhase 1: rEVMOS Testnet(in progress) [Now- Sep 30 2022]\nPhase 2: rEVMOS Mainnet Release and rDEX Listing [Early October 2022]\nPhase 3: Initial DeFi Integrations on the Cosmos Ecosystem [Rest of 2022]\nPhase 4: Ongoing Maintenance, Upgrades, and Further Work on Integrations [from 2023 onwards]\n\nConclusion\nThe Evmos is one of the important players in the Cosmos Ecosystem. StaFiHub hopes to work with the Evmos community to create new use cases for the $EVMOS token, as well as introduce a brand new interest bearing asset to the Cosmos community.\n\nPlease feel free to provide any feedback or suggestion you may have below or email us.\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-19T07:47:44.999Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":true,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10c0998w6el4dmz6lcuy2dkp9tr6sv2xulherjq\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Overview\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nHi Evmos community, StaFiHub (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.stafihub.io/\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://www.stafihub.io/\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\") is a fully fledged project based on the Cosmos SDK developed by StaFi protocol to provide Liquid Staking Derivative SDK solutions for Cosmos Ecosystem projects.

Evmosians:\n\nThis is cryptoallen from spacefi.io. We're planning an incentive program to launch bridges competition and bootstrap Evmos liquidity. Hope to get feedback from community.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe program is divided into two phases:\n\nFirst, bridges competition, one week event\n\nUsers use bridges and ERC20 module to transfer Ethereum and IBC assets into Evmos ERC20 assets. The rewards including EVMOS and STAR (SpaceFi token) airdrop will be allocated based on deposit amount and ranking.\n\nSecond, matching EVMOS rewards to EVMOS liquidity incentives on SpaceFi.\n\nSpaceFi will allocate 40% of daily farming reward to the main Evmos liquidity pools, hoping to match a certain amount of EVMOS rewards to better boost Evmos native liquidity.\n\nThis proposal is based on three important principles:\n\n1. Let community choose bridges and assets through deposit. Allocate incentive weights by bridges competition and community. This should be open and transparent.\n\n2. This proposal will limit the size of the funding request, and after achieving milestones, more funding can be requested depending on the situation.\n\n3. We should incentivize Evmos native liquidity APR, but can’t rely on APR alone. It’s more important to build unique usecases and ecosystem, which is also what SpaceFi incubation platform is doing.\n\nAmount of Funds Requested\n\nWe plan to apply for 360,000 EVMOS. Of this, 30,000 EVMOS are used for the first phase of matching rewards for deposit, through a total deposit ladder reward program that will hopefully bring in $5,000,000 assets or more into Evmos. 330,000 EVMOS are used for the second phase of matching rewards for Evmos liquidity incentives, where there is a ladder reward program based on liquidity of $1,000,000 - $10,000,000, lasting up to 82 days.\n\nGoals\n\n1. Bring in $500,000-$5,000,000 assets for Evmos through bridges and ERC20 module. Bring in $1,000,000-$10,000,000 liquidity for Evmos main trading pairs on SpaceFi through liquidity incentives. Also, reduce liquidity fragmentation by selecting major bridge assets to incentivize through community feedback and actual deposits.\n\n2. Attract Cosmos and Ethereum communities to make deposits, withdrawals, conversions using bridges and ERC20 modules. Learn about the unique value of Evmos for IBC and ERC20 asset conversion.\n\n3. Guide community to focus on Evmos native DAPPs and promote the building of a unique Evmos ecosystem through overall exploration event and publicity of the liquidity incentive program.\n\nFund Utilization Plan\n\nPhase 1: Bridges Competition\n\n1. Deposit funds: USDC, ETH, wBTC, ATOM, OSMO, JUNO\n\n2. Bridges: Axelar, ceBridge, Gravity Bridge, Multichain, ERC20 module\n\n3. Deposit amount and reward: one week event\n\nTo make the fund utilization more effective, we have set up a ladder rewards program.\n\nTotal deposit $0-$500,000, total reward will be 5000EVMOS ($15000) + 300000STAR ($15000), equivalent to $600-$30000 per $10,000 deposit (extreme theoretical situation, actual does not exist). The APR is 219%-∞.\n\nTotal deposits $500,000-$1,000,000, total reward will be 10,000 EVMOS ($30,000) + 600,000 STAR ($30,000), equivalent to $600-$1200 per $10,000 deposit. The APR is 219%-438%.\n\n…\n\nLadder reward program based on total deposit, as below:\n\n(click the link of the excel)\n\n(image)\n\nWe will temporarily request 30,000 EVMOS (about $90,000) for Phase 1, while SpaceFi will provide 1,800,000 STAR airdrops (at a minimum initial value of $90,000). Reward usage will be based on the actual total deposit amount, and any unused EVMOS will be transferred to the liquidity incentive for the second phase. For example, if the total deposit amount is $1,000,000, then 10,000 EVMOS reward will be allocated and the remaining 20,000 EVMOS will be used for the second phase of the liquidity incentive.\n\n4. Badge NFT\n\nAll valid depositors will be able to mint an Evmos Explorer badge NFT as an Evmos contributor symbol. We encourage other eco-projects to offer special rewards for Evmos Explorer NFT holders as well when distributing rewards to the Evmos community.\n\n5. Other:\n\n(1) Valid deposit requirement is ERC20 assets on EVMOS, if transferring funds via IBC, you need to convert to ERC20 assets via Evmos Assets page.\n\n(2) We will use the total amount of deposits, the number of active deposit addresses and community feedback for each bridge as the basis for selecting bridges and assigning reward weights in the second phase.\n\n(3) If the total amount of deposits exceeds $5,000,000, the multi-signature managers may decide whether to allocate more from the overall 360,000 EVMOS rewards to the Phase 1 rewards.\n\nPhase 2: Incentivize EVMOS liquidity on SpaceFi\n\n1. Expected incentive trading pairs: EVMOS-USDC, EVMOS-ETH, EVMOS-wBTC, EVMOS-ATOM, EVMOS-OSMO, EVMOS-JUNO, STAR(SpaceFi token)-EVMOS, which will be adjusted and reward weights assigned based on Phase 1 deposits.\n\n2. Bridge selection: based on the total amount of deposits in the first phase, the number of active deposit addresses and community feedback.\n\n3. Liquidity and rewards:\n\nWe will temporarily request 330,000 EVMOS (about $990,000) for phase 2, while SpaceFi will allocate 40% of the daily farming reward (about 133,000 STAR/day based on initial emissions) to the main EVMOS trading pairs.\n\nWe have two plans for liquidity incentive to choose and want to get feedback from community:\n\n(1) Ladder reward program, which can make the APR more steady as TVL grows:\n\nLiquidity $ 0-1M, daily reward will be 4000 EVMOS (~$12000) + 133K STAR (~$6650) . The APR will be 681%-∞.\n\nLiquidity $1-2M, daily reward will be 5000 EVMOS (~$15000) + 133,000 STAR (~$6650). The APR will be 209%-418%.\n\n…\n\n(click the link of the excel)\n\n(image)\n\nThe above APR is our preset based on the Evmos liquidity APR on Osmosis and Evmos staking APR. Because we need to consider the impermanent loss and user acceptance of the new ecosystem, so the APR needs to be higher to create a greater attraction than the Osmosis liquidity incentive and Evmos staking reward. Also, because STAR is calculated based on the initial minimum value, the actual value should be higher, and therefore the actual APR will be higher.\n\n(2) Fixed reward program, which can make the initial APR very high:\n\n(click the link of the excel)\n\n(image)\n\n4. Other:\n\nIf the liquidity exceeds $10,000,000, the multi-signatory managers can decide whether to increase the reward and continue to apply for more reward from Evmos community.\n\nMultisig Wallet Signatories\n\nThe multisig that controls these funds will be a 4 out of 6 consisting of:\n\nOne Evmos core team member (TBD)\n\nLPX, Evmos Governance Workstream member\n\nOne Evmos Governance Workstream member (TBD)\n\nOne Evmos Community member (open, TBD)\n\ncryptoallen, builder of SpaceFi\n\ndevd, Evmos Governance Workstream / Evmos Community Manager / SpaceFi Community Manager\n\nThe members will be confirmed later in disscusion.\n\nAbout SpaceFi\n\nSpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Starter+Spacebase as initial product. The first to connect Cosmos and Layer2. https://www.spacefi.io/\n\nSpaceFi is a community-driven project. We’ve been testing on Evmos and zkSync and is one of the most active projects on testnet, gaining recognition from a large number of Evmos and Ethereum community members, with over 20,000 active testers.\n\nWe have completed the audit report of some contracts (Audit Report) . If the proposal passed, it will be executed after the audit of the relevant contracts is completed.\n\nSpaceFi combines DeFi and NFT, giving NFT gaming and financial attributes, as well as additional benefits and governance rights. At the same time, SpaceFi has a well-designed deflationary model to facilitate continued growth. (SpaceFi Tokenomics)\n\nSpaceFi is not only a DeFi+NFT dapp, but also hopes to incubate more ecological projects through its Starter platform and become an engine of ecosystem development. We’re actively promoting Evmos ecosystem and are a partner and mentor in #EvmosMomentum hackathon by Huobi Incubator and Evmos. In the near future, the first project incubated by our community will also be launched.","kind":"discussion","stage":"Voting","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-18T17:58:48.311Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1mk98x7jvsmmnymlypphmyddug7wpc4ur0zralz\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"cryptoallen|spacefi.io\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"builder of SpaceFi\\\\n\\\\nSpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform with DEX+NFT+Launchpad+Spacebase on Evmos and zkSync.\\\\n\\\\nwebsite: https://www.spacefi.io/\\\\n\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b082f11f-f16f-436f-8d4c-e6539f95d1f2.png\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-07-28T02:59:18.413Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Dear Evmosians:\\\\n\\\\nThis is cryptoallen from spacefi.io.

thread is aimed at gauging community sentiment on incentivizing native DeFi on Evmos. All details are open to suggestions. This would be an initial kickoff followed by a comprehensive and continued Liquidity Incentive program for native DeFi formed by the community.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Evmos blockchain is a superior environment for DeFi, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth in the Evmos ecosystem. We have also had very attractive staking APR that gave a higher return than most liquidity pools, and a bridge exploit that drained the majority of TVL that was taking part in DeFi protocols.\n\nWe have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 5th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $9.8M and 4th highest daily volume of $3.1M. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring soon, and token holders will be looking at what other options are out there.\n\nIt is time we use that strategy to give native DeFi in the Evmos ecosystem a boost and attract liquidity and community members from throughout the interchain. Staking returns will be dropping significantly, and it is a chance for DeFi to be appealing to users. With the Community Treasury sitting at approximately 32.75M EVMOS tokens, a clawback just short of 75M EVMOS tokens, and the usage incentives escrow wallet at almost 35M tokens for a grand total of over 142M, we are in a comfortable position to take action and create a thriving DeFi ecosystem on Evmos. With 200M EVMOS tokens (roughly 20% of the total supply) allocated to incentives over the first 4 years, the tokenomics of Evmos were meant to support DeFi long term, as well as act aggressively in its early stages.\n\nThe high staking APR is coming down, and we currently have around 2M EVMOS tokens being unbonded within the next 14 days that will become liquid. Rather than those tokens be sold or taken over to Osmosis, we should move to encourage those funds to stay native and get attractive yields by doing so.\n\nPlan of Action:\n\nWe need to revive Evmos DeFi with a bang by deploying incentives on Diffusion to attract DeFi users and their liquidity. Diffusion will be in prime position as a DEX to attract users to pool their assets for high yields while also providing a place to gain exposure to a variety of assets. As a starting point for discussion, here is an initial suggestion to deploy EVMOS incentivizes to attract liquidity for EVMOS pairs with ATOM, WETH, WBTC, OSMO, JUNO, DIFF, and Stable Coins.\n\n\n(1M, 2M, or 3M) 2M EVMOS tokens designated for Diffusion to incentivize liquidity pools over 90 days managed by a multisig consisting of the Diffusion team, the Evmos team, and members from the Evmos Community (or 180 days with double tokens). \n\n The EVMOS token incentive breakdown for those pools would be as follows:\n\nAfter taking feedback, and working with what is technically feasible at the moment, here’s the breakdown of pool incentives of which the proposal which put forward:\n\nEVMOS/ATOM - 400k\nEVMOS/wETH - 400k (200k each Axelar, Celer)\nEVMOS/wBTC - 200k (66.7k each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\nEVMOS/stables - 700k (175k each Axelar, Celer USDC & grav USDT, DAI) \nEVMOS/OSMO - 100k\nEVMOS/JUNO - 100k\nEVMOS/DIFF - 100k\n{excludes Evmos/gravUSDC} \n\nOver the first 14 days funds will be split evenly between pools in each category, followed by distribution proportionate to each pool's TVL & Volume accordingly. 50% of the category incentives based upon TVL, and 50% based upon volume to fairly distribute incentives to the most valuable pools.\n\n[Assuming 2M Evmos]\n\nEVMOS/ATOM - 400k\nEVMOS/wETH - 300k (100k each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\nEVMOS/wBTC - 300k (100k each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\nEVMOS/USDC - 700k (233.33k each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\nEVMOS/OSMO - 100k \nEVMOS/JUNO - 100k \nEVMOS/DIFF - 50k\nDIFF/xxx - 50k\n\n\nWe can kick this off equal distribution of incentives between the bridged assets. Promoting somewhat of a bridge war or \"Game of Bridges\" could draw attention and drive competition for assets. Then props following these can use that to gauge the bridge incentives. This will help the most desired liquidity continue to come onto Evmos and maintain attractive APRs while doing so. The goal is for our TVL to reach $20M by the end of the year.\n\n2M EVMOS is less than 1.5% of our available funds, and covers an entire DEX and interchain assets vs .5% at the time for the single EVMOS/OSMO pool on an external DEX. I firmly believe this would be a worthwhile spend to liven Evmos DeFi, and be the catalyst to jumpstart development and activity on the Evmos blockchain.\n\nFollowing this initial incentive proposal, we deploy an ongoing liquidity program to follow up on these incentives as well as onboarding new projects and DeFi applications with EVMOS incentives. (Agreeing to this proposal is not a commitment to a follow up liquidity incentive program)\n\nAbout Diffusion:\n\nDiffusion is a decentralized Uniswap v2 fork built on top of Evmos featuring no bonding periods pays a portion of the trading fees back to DIFF stakers. It was the first AMMs for Evmos, and arguably the more user ready DEX on Evmos. It seeks to unlock the potential of combining smart-contract based applications with the specific capabilities of other Cosmos chains to drive a new set of use cases in DeFi and beyond.\n\n\nPlease provide any feedback you may have so we can iterate this idea into a form that is fit to pass a vote.\n\n26/09/2022 - Benny added updated chart based with new pairs & token allocations. Changed token price from $3 to $2.

on Words and Concepts\n\nWords are a form of cached consensus between individuals/groups and the larger society.\n\nConsensus on words and concepts (since they serve as cache) should be next to

If they are neologisms, their lemma will be updated in governance texts according to (2) and (3) as soon as those sources get to contain the words or/and concepts.\n\nThe exact link between words and concepts is not required for each word of a gov proposal, but the links have to be resolved by the proposer for each and every challenge (in the off-chain proposal discussions) of the meaning of a word or punctuation sign that may substantially change the global meaning of any gov proposal.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Laurel Project Governance .

Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\n\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade.

everyone! \n\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes. This is a good example of the importance of testing upgrades in a testnet environment. The main issue that we discovered was that Metamask transactions could not be submitted, because the UI didn't allow large differences between the base fee and the min gas price. \n\nThis thread is following up with scheduling the `v6.0.1` software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000\n](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200 ) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v6.0.1` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters.\n* Allow Metamask transactions with min gas price\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `20,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5922-evmos-software-upgrade-v601).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-28T20:52:29.676Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-17T14:01:27.792Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"Hey everyone! \\n\\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes.

I'm opening up this thread on scheduling the next software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v5.0.0` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `25,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).

GRANT PROPOSAL // PARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nOne Sentence Description: “Sequester-To-Earn” Platform that incentivizes climate action\n\nWebsite:  www.avatree.xyz\n\nTwitter/IG: @_avatree\n\nMISSION AND VISION\n\nAvatree is a “Sequester-To-Earn” platform where people are incentivized to take climate action.\n\nWe see climate change as a collective coordination problem. Since web3 has been incredibly effective at solving such problems, our vision is to adapt key learnings from web3 to onboard millions of people to the climate movement and accelerate carbon sequestration efforts worldwide.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe user purchases a subscription of carbon credits along with an Avatree NFT, which is a digital sapling. As the user makes their monthly payments to purchase carbon credits, the sapling grows algorithmically and fruits Avatree tokens. This token can be spent to personalize their Avatree NFT, attend IRL / online events and purchase brand rewards. Alternatively the user can trade their tokens on the open market for cash.\n\nBUSINESS MODEL\n\nWe earn money by:\n\n1. Charging for Avatree NFTs - $25-$100/each, 100% margin\n\n2. Monthly carbon credit subscription - $10-$100/month, 3.5% margin\n\n3. NFT Resale Revenue - 5% of resale\n\nTEAM\n\nChetan Nandakumar - CEO/Product:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnandakumar\n\n• 10+ years as PM and ML engineer at companies such as Recruitbot & Leap Motion\n\n• Co-founder of Modista.com - computer vision for apparel search\n\n• UC Berkeley PhD in AI & Neuroscience, NSF Graduate Fellow\n\nTyler Streeter - Graphics Engineer:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerstreeter/\n\n• Founder of iBonsai iOS app, 120K total downloads, 55K paid downloads\n\n• PhD in AI, MS in VR from Iowa State University\n\n• Portfolio: http://tyl.st/projects/\n\nAnusheel Bhushan - Full Stack Engineer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusheel/\n\n• Founder of Strive Labs.\n\n• Principal Engineer, eBay\n\n• BS IIT Delhi, MS UC Irvine\n\nChris Znerold - Design Lead:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/znerold/\n\n• Founder of Stay.Gold Design Firm: www.stay.gold\n\n• Design Lead at AirBnB, Apple Music & Disney Interactive\n\n• Creative Director at PlayStation\n\n• Portfolio:  http://znerold.com/\n\nADVISORS\n\nBradley Horowitz, VP Product at Google:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradleyhorowitz/\n\n• VP Product at Google\n\n• Former head of GMail, GCalendar, Google Voice, and many other Google teams\n\n• MIT Media Alum\n\nPhilip Taylor, Climate Scientist:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipgrahamtaylor/\n\n• Climate Fellow at UC Boulder\n\n• Founder Mad Agriculture - helping farmers turn their operations to being regenerative\n\n• PhD from UC Boulder in Climate Science\n\nPARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nRegen Network is a blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem and a leading provider of carbon and ecological credits in the ReFi space. They will serve as a key partner with us, providing us with the carbon credits that power our platform, and promoting us to their community.\n\nHOW CAN WE BE SURE THESE CREDITS ARE REAL?\n\nThe carbon credit / ecological credit industry holds a lot of potential to support climate restoration, but it’s also a new, unregulated industry and ripe with abuse.\n\nWe take this issue seriously and are taking the following measures to ensure that the credits purchased through our platform contribute to tangible and meaningful climate action:\n\n1. We will only be selecting those credits that match the following criteria:\n\nNature based - restoring ecological habitats\n\nClear and proven additionality - a given habitat would not have been restored without additional funding\n\nMeasurable impact - can the activities to preserve or regenerate ecology be measured and confirmed? What are the downstream outcomes from this land preservation or restoration (ie. improvements in soil health, biodiversity, water quality, etc)\n\n2. Regen Network, our supplier for carbon credits, is a pioneer in this ReFi industry and is leading the way for high-end ecological credits and industry standards. Here’s are links to articles about some of their carbon credits:\n\nNCT, Nature Carbon Tonne:  https://medium.com/regen-network/introducing-nature-carbon-ton-nct-6d0fbaaf490d\n\nCarbonPlus Grasslands credits:  https://registry.regen.network/methodologies/carbonplus-grasslands\n\n3. Phil Taylor (see above), a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur, has joined our team as an advisor and will be guiding our carbon credit strategy\n\n4. Using web3 increases transparency around these credits. Each credit will be on-chain and labeled with its location, the person/agency who created the credit, the independent verifier, related images, etc.\n\nMARKET TRENDS\n\n• NFTs grew 23x from 2020 to 2021 into a $23B industry\n\n• The voluntary carbon market will grow 15x and will be worth upwards of $50B by 2030\n\n• There are 10+ consumer carbon offset products on the market, but none have garnered widespread adoption (see “Competition” section below)\n\nCORE ASSUMPTION\n\nOur core assumption is that there’s a massive untapped market of individuals who want to take climate action but just need a nudge to do so. We believe that nudge consists of social and financial incentives.\n\nCOMPETITION & UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nThere is a burgeoning demand for carbon offsetting products from consumers, and there are 10+ consumer-oriented carbon offsetting products on the market attempting to meet this need.\n\nSome of the key players in our space are Klima, Wren (YC and Union Square Ventures backed), Joro (Sequoia Backed), and Terrapass. All these products take a dry, individualized approach to carbon offsetting. They ask the user questions to assess their carbon footprint, and then allow them to offset it by purchasing a monthly subscription of carbon credits.\n\nAlthough these products have engaged hundreds of thousands of people, none of them have garnered widespread adoption, leaving open a massive market opportunity. The existing products have poor UX without any gamification or integrated social engagement. By creating a social, incentivized solution, Avatree aims to seize this market opportunity.\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nWe will grow our user base through web3 and web2 strategies such as community building through Discord / Twitter spaces / influencer engagement, and social media marketing.\n\nAlso, by addressing climate, a topic of growing global concern, we can leverage existing communities in the climate space. Since Avatree is a monetized platform, we can sign on these organizations as affiliates, so that they get paid when their members sign up for Avatree.\n\nTRACTION\n\nWe launched a preview of our algorithmic tree at  VERSE , an augmented reality art gallery in SF and Denver. Visitors experience the Avatree exhibit as a 16ft 3D hologram that grows from sapling to tree in 4 minutes. We're on display alongside top-end artists such as Android Jones and Zed Run and have become a \"crowd favorite\" of the gallery. Since February, VERSE has had 15K guests in SF and Denver and will be expanding to 15 locations around the world in 2022.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n- Accepted to the 2022 Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator, a non-dilutive accelerator, 6% acceptance rate\n\n- Accepted to the World Economic Forum's 2022 Crypto Impact and Sustainability Accelerator & Crypto Sustainability Coalition\n\nWORKING PROTOTYPE\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pde95ir1u4s24o3/avatree-video.mp4?dl=0\n\nDECK\n\nhttps://docsend.com/view/nvdvw6q4nyuqkvtp\n\nTECHNICAL ROADMAP\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mrwi491mpv522y1/Avatree%20Tech%20Roadmap.pdf?dl=0\n\nMILESTONES\n\nMilestone 1, Initial Kickoff, Nov 1, 2022\n\nMilestone 2, Dec 15, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm for single growing tree\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 1 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 3, Feb 1, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm that can grow multiple trees\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 2 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 4, Mar 15, 2023, $20k\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 3 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\n- Public Launch of Avatree Product to Potential Consumers\n\nTOTAL: $100k\n\nHEADCOUNT BREAKDOWN\n\nFull Stack Engineer, 16 weeks, Full-time, $45/hr, $28.8k\n\nBlockchain Engineer, 12 weeks, Full-time, $60/hr, $28.8k\n\nGraphics/AI Engineer, 8 weeks, Full-time, $70/hr, $20.6\n\nDesigner, 16 weeks, Quarter-time, $70/hr, $12k\n\nSmart Contract / Backend Testing and Revision - $10k\n\nBENEFIT TO EVMOS\n\nWhen we launch the platform (in March 2023) we anticipate selling 2k-5k NFTs. Pricing them at the lower end of the scale, this would translate to $50k-$125k in EVMOS tokens. Additionally, if each person purchases ~$10 in carbon credits per month, this translates to $20k - $50k in carbon credits purchased each month on COSMOS\n\nIn one year, we anticipate increasing our userbase to 10k-25k users. So this would translate to $250k-$625k in EVMOS tokens. And then more as we continue to grow the network in the next few years.\n\nFYI, an important distinction with our model is that there is no cap to the the number of NFTs we mint. The financial incentives for participation center around the token rewards generated by the NFTs. Our vision is for this to be a consumer product with hundreds of thousands of users in the years ahead\n\nFUTURE EXPANSION\n\nAfter the completion of this grant, Avatree will continue to expand its userbase and product offerings.
