Upgrade block TBA.\n\nMotivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our Software Upgrade Guide .\n\nImpact\n\nEvmos v10 contains all changes from the previous \"v10.0.0-rc1\" upgrade , as well as the following enhancements:\n\nAutomatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving\n\nEvmos now also supports ERC20 token transfers via IBC\n\nAdd Ledger support to the evmosd CLI\n\nThe funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated\n\nIntroduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)\n\nEIP-712 fixes for the vesting module\n\nAdd a default file store listener for a basic implementation of ADR-038: State Listening\n\nUpdate Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.6 and Ethermint v0.20.0-rc4\n\nA full changelog can be found here .\n\nNOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\n\nTesting\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found here .

everyone! \n\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes. This is a good example of the importance of testing upgrades in a testnet environment. The main issue that we discovered was that Metamask transactions could not be submitted, because the UI didn't allow large differences between the base fee and the min gas price. \n\nThis thread is following up with scheduling the `v6.0.1` software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000\n](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200 ) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet.

 Govmos Team (a multi-chain volunteer initiative to reform Cosmos governance)\n\nSummary : This proposal seeks to formalize the structure of DAO councils. Introducing 4 \"council types\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce a technical solution to separate security & vote delegation of the tokens. Allowing users to both delegate security to a validator and delegate vote to a council.\n\nAbstract:  Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix ). By doing this we end up with a much more decentralized system where every market participant is represented (appendix 2) compared to the current one in which only team & validators do governance. Each council type having a clear role to play in the ecosystem's governance balance (appendix 3).\n\nMotivation:  Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs.\n\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\n\n1- History :\n\nFollowing from the rejected vote of the proposition #86 ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the community funds requested by the \"main-DAO\". This main-DAO that was recently formalized in the previous proposition #83 by the same persons willing to occupy the DAO seats. First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the candidates & one to request the funding. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would probably push to centralize the system.\n\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted.\n\n2- Govmos Proposition :\n\nNow that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\n\na) Separating Security & Governance Delegation\n\nWe have multiple solutions here, but the endgame is to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power to. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\n\nIF the token holder cast the vote himself THEN the vote is casted\n\nELSE IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\n\nIF he delegated his vote to a council, THEN the council cast the vote on his behalf.\n\nELSE the validator(s) which he delegated to can cast the vote instead.\n\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\n\nb) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\n\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \"council types\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \"council type\" can have as many \"councils\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\n\nHere are the formal amendments :\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" requires all 4 council types to be \"active\".\n\nThe 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\n\nEach council must have separate accounting in the Treasury Module.\n\nEach council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered \"active\"\n\nEach council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\n\nFoundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \"foundation council\".\n\nWallets related to validators + validator delegations (excl. liquid stake) for any \"validators council\".\n\nAddresses having deployed smart contracts for any \"developer council\"\n\nAddresses having never transacted with the above for any \"delegator council\"\n\nCouncils are prohibited to use or request Community Pool funds.\n\nIf the \"main-DAO\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \"Inactive\".\n\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \"active\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. In order to understand which role each council type could play in the DAO, you can refer to the Appendix 2 & 4 at the bottom of that post.\n\nc) Improving on ECP-1A vision\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \"main-DAO\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \"main DAO\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\n\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\n\n3- Govmos vision :\n\nWe want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details.

Introducing 4 \\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce the Treasury Module meant to regulate capital flows of the councils in a transparent and trust-minimized way. As well as signaling an update on the forthcoming Liquid Staking Module (LSM)\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstract:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix). Our proposition states that the most accurate way to auto-regulate the system is to separate capital flows between the councils and define a clear set of standards & rules to regulate such flows. Our model also states that the current system of a \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"sub-DAOs\\\\\\\" workstream is extremely centralized and we will explain why such system has failed in its chain approval process lately. We seek to replace that formal system by implementing 4 types of councils that will compose the aforementioned \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" to maintain its critical center role as decentralized as possible. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Motivation:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1- History :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Following from the rejected vote of the \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/86\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #86\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about the legitimacy of that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the proposition to fund the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". This main-DAO was formalized in the previous \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #83\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\". First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the structure & one to request the funding. By pushing them both in a same proposal the community couldn't vote on each. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would push to centralize the system.\\\\n\\\\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted. \\\\n\\\\n2- Govmos Proposition :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Now that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"a) Signaling an update to the Liquid Staking Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe plan to use the forthcoming LSM (Liquid Staking Module) to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power. This bond can be easily broken by introducing \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Liquid Staked Vote Transport\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" (LSVT). This would allow the voting rights of the liquid staked tokens to be transferred along with them instead of the validators. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\\\\nThe holder can cast his own vote if he wants to.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the liquid staked token is deposited in the Treasury THEN the council who has that delegated token can cast the vote on the holder's behalf.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user has not delegated its token in the Treasury THEN the vote is casted by the validators he has chosen to delegate its security to (the existing model).\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder has chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\\\\nThis step is crucial to our model but the most important part to decentralize governance comes in the next part.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"b) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \\\\\\\"council type\\\\\\\" can have as many \\\\\\\"councils\\\\\\\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\\\\n\\\\nHere are the formal amendments :\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" requires at least one \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\" council for each of the 4 council types.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council must have separate accounting.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered registered\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Foundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \\\\\\\"foundation council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Validators delegated tokens (non liquid-staked) for any \\\\\\\"validators council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having deployed smart contracts for any \\\\\\\"developer council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having never transacted with the above for any \\\\\\\"delegator council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"If the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \\\\\\\"Inactive\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"c) Improving on ECP-1A vision\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \\\\\\\"main DAO\\\\\\\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \\\\\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\\\\\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\\\\n\\\\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"d) Prepare Discussion on the Treasury Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe also consider essential to have each council having a separate accounting in the forthcoming Treasury Module; it will be in charge of regulating capital flows in the councils with smart contracts. This is meant to reduce trust assumptions to the minimum by enforcing the rules that allow capital to move inside the council. It shall restricts spending & specify the potential compensations the council members may ask for (using the compensation framework proposed in ECP-1B which we think can be applied in its current form without amendments). \\\\n\\\\nBut we insist that the money flows inside councils MUST be regulated in a specific chain module via smart contracts. This process should not require ratification by on-chain governance (as opposed to community pool allocation) as its to the discretion of each council to formalize its own internal operating rules & compensation frameworks. \\\\n\\\\nWe have detailed the reasons why different councils may have different models in our research publication (cf. appendix 4)\\\\nThe token holders will have to do their due-diligence before delegating their liquid staked tokens to a council via the treasury module. As some councils may use the delegated funds to pay for regular expenses & the compensation framework (see page 4 of the research). Of course on a separate proposal we will explore the base protection & standards required to these treasury module smart contracts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3- Govmos vision :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONCLUSION\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details.

Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment |   Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 | \n| --------      | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty     | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. |  Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training.  | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size  | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role.  | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill.

Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders. \n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: \n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking. \n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members. \n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle: \n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1     | Self       | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties.     |\n| 1.5     | Workstream / subDAO       | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream.  |\n| 2     | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3.     |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO. \n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":2491,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-10T18:08:15.675Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-09T17:37:12.548Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Standardized Compensation Framework\\n\\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 606,000 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 300,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 600,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,831,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles. The goal of these full-time contributor roles is to find the next leaders that will step up and establish their own workstreams. \\n\\n - Department of Education\\n \\n     - The mission of the Department of Education is to develop, maintain, and promote educational contents and programs for the Evmos Community. \\n     - This includes the creation of interactive educational content in governance related topics, and eventually the creation of technical content for developers.\\n\\n - Department of Communications\\n\\n     - The Department of Communications is responsible for creating and coordinating direct dialogue between the Evmos DAO and the diverse Community Members.\\n     - Through outreach, communication, townhall meetings, and official announcements from the Governance Council and the various workstreams of the DAO, the Dept. of Communications removes obstacles and barriers and creates opportunities to improve public awareness and involvement in the DAO.\\n     - The Department of Communications will also be responsible for the creation of documentation and communication channels in non-English languages.\\n     - The Department of Communications helps build and maintain the transparent, responsible, and accountable governance system that the Constitution calls for.\\n\\n - Department of Growth & Outreach\\n\\n     - The Department of Growth will be responsible for the strategic outreach and engagement of developers, projects, and other DAOs for the purpose of ecosystem growth.\\n     - Through the generation of leads, coordination with biz dev, outreach campaigns, and strategic bounties, the Department of Growth should ramp up community engagement, elevate the Evmos brand and awareness, illustrate our vision, mission, and values, and enable the facilitation of easy onboarding of projects and developers.\\n\\n - Department of Research & Development\\n\\n     - The Department of R&D will work closely with the Governance Council to research, develop, and maintain key infrastructure, public goods, and the development of smart contracts.

The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.\n2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.\n3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Federico Kunze signed the confirmations for the effort, as a comment on [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2), but he recently deleted that comment (he deleted all his public confirmations of my volunteering).\n4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).\n\n## Retroactive Payment\n\n359.5h * 255 euro/h = 91,672.5 eur\n\n\n## The Meaning of the Vote\n\n1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.\n2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above)\n\n## Author\n\nLoredana Cirstea, volunteer for The Laurel Project.\n\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-21T21:47:32.021Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos17ucx8wx9mz9f2a4ccum536gthydprcumuchveh\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Loredana\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Volunteer from The Laurel Project.

Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.\\n\\nThe Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.\\n\\n## The Public Goods Created\\n\\n[22 Feb - 21 March 2022: ~359.5h](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md)\\n\\n### Ethermint: ~100h\\n\\n- AnteHandler - GasMeter with unenforced gasWanted limit, to be used for bounding block gas in the block proposal phase [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/964](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/964) (reading docs, implementing, debugging - 55h)\\n- eth_feeHistory - fix reward calculation [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/990](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/990) after 2 quick fixes ([https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/970](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/970), [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/975](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/975)) - trying to reproduce the issue ([https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13649#issuecomment-1067953572](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13649#issuecomment-1067953572), [https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13874#issuecomment-1067390401](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13874#issuecomment-1067390401)), sync mainnet/testnet nodes, implement fix, write issues, help document postmortem - 45h\\n\\n### Integration Testing for Evmos Vesting Module: ~30h\\n\\n[https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317/commits/2f3682d63906d11eb764f40d83928345465f30ad](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317/commits/2f3682d63906d11eb764f40d83928345465f30ad)\\n\\nI have discovered the following implementations that did not conform with the intent (bug):\\n- vested but unlocked coins were allowed to be delegated - [https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/286#pullrequestreview-893077040](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/286#pullrequestreview-893077040)\\n- clawback before unlock would also clawback vested coins\\n\\n### Integration Testing for Evmos Claims Module: ~55h\\n\\n[https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/373](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/373)\\n\\n### PR Reviews: ~3h\\n\\n- [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/935](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/935)\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/953\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/968\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/991\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/339\\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/360\\n\\n### JS notebooks for testing: 8h\\n\\nScript for sending multiple transactions to evmos with random gas prices/fees, or testing Metamask: [https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-stress-test](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-stress-test)\\nPlayground for testing evmosjs libs: [https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-js](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-js).\\n\\n\\n### Evmos Core Team Calls\\n\\nPresence in calls: 9*0.5 + 1 * 2 = 6.5h\\n\\n### Other tasks for Evmos: 5h\\n\\n- [my moral take on Evmos launch and upgrade fail](https://github.com/the-laurel/governance/blob/main/docs/EthicsOfBlockchainGovernance.md): 3h\\n- the present document: 2h\\n\\n### Video Demos of What can be built on Evmos\\n\\n(the ideas presented in the videos are the intellectual property of The Laurel Project and are outside the scope of this proposal)\\n\\n#### EVM interpreter precompile (demoed on an Evmos fork): 43h\\n\\n- video Feb 26, 2022: [https://youtu.be/uzc1ijYhZE8](https://youtu.be/uzc1ijYhZE8)\\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\\n- precompile programming: 36h\\n- dapp: 3h\\n\\n\\n#### EVM Interpreter Precompile used as a Trustworthy Compute Engine (with a spreadsheet engine): 33h\\n\\n- video Mar 5, 2022: [https://youtu.be/kHDxDiM5xvQ](https://youtu.be/kHDxDiM5xvQ)\\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\\n- precompile programming: 20h\\n- dapp: 9h\\n\\n#### Generalized Replay Bridge with Ethereum VM, IBC (Cosmos) & Evmos: 49h\\n\\n- video Mar 13, 2022: [https://youtu.be/ayFzY4btFX4](https://youtu.be/ayFzY4btFX4)\\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 5h\\n- precompile programming: 40h\\n- dapp: 4h\\n\\n#### Gas Refill Precompile - Prepay Ethereum VM transactions: 27h\\n\\n- video Mar 19, 2022: [https://youtu.be/S9HLBwG6Ifo](https://youtu.be/S9HLBwG6Ifo)\\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\\n- precompile programming: 20h\\n- dapp: 3h\\n\\n\\n## Proofs\\n\\n1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.\\n2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.\\n3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Federico Kunze signed the confirmations for the effort, as a comment on [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2), but he recently deleted that comment (he deleted all his public confirmations of my volunteering).\\n4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).\\n\\n## Retroactive Payment\\n\\n359.5h * 255 euro/h = 91,672.5 eur\\n\\n\\n## The Meaning of the Vote\\n\\n1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.\\n2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above)\\n\\n## Author\\n\\nLoredana Cirstea, volunteer for The Laurel Project.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-12-21T21:47:32.026Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T21:45:53.096Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-22T21:45:53.096Z","Address":{"id":48221,"address":"evmos17ucx8wx9mz9f2a4ccum536gthydprcumuchveh","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-07-31T18:07:19.415Z","keytype":null,"name":"Loredana","last_active":"2022-12-21T21:47:32.053Z","user_id":37231,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":34514,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":37231},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1160,"name":"3.

Club’s Evmos Grants Proposal\n\nI. Summary\n\nEncode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps.\n\nEncode Club will organise a pilot grants programme for the Evmos community for H1 2023 (Jan to July). Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the DAO.\n\nRegular community calls shall be established and kept open to both the community and the DAO, which are to be used for questions, feedback and general updates about the programme’s progress. Additionally, 3 special check-in calls will be scheduled and executed throughout the programme - one following the successful setup of the grants programme, one midway through and one at the very end, the purpose of which is for Encode to provide further insight regarding grant applications and subsequently grantees.\n\nEncode Club is requesting $2-5MM in total to award to the best builders and projects for the duration of the programme. Allocated funds are to be kept in the Multisig controlled by the Evmos community and distributed only when needed by Encode via multisig composed of trusted community advisory members. Encode’s monthly expenses for running the programme will be $50k, which can be considered as part of the total requested grants amount as per the DAO’s preference.\n\nII. Encode Club\n\nEncode is one of the most trusted and well known companies within the web3 space, known for delivery of top tier programmes in partnership with the biggest names in the industry. Over the past two years their team has managed to successfully execute more than 90 events (both online and in-person).\n\nThe following are examples of the wide array of events conceptualised, marketed, organised and executed solely by the Encode team:\n\n 1.

Secret Sauce\n\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are the means by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\n\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse. Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\n\nEnsuring and maintaining the level of talent is a continuous task. The following are some of the implemented techniques and approaches that keeps the talent bar high and rising.\n\n1. Sourcing\n\nA significant amount of time and work is invested in making sure the best developers within a given ecosystem are both identified and made aware of an upcoming programme. To achieve this, the Encode team is keeping a close eye on every single event within the web3 space and tries to identify promising teams and projects alike. Getting in touch with them and inviting them to our own programme where they’ll be given a stage to perform and compete for great prizes is a priority. Furthermore, Encode Club is in direct communication with the majority of university blockchain clubs in existence around the world. Ensuring a close and warm bond with these societies contributes to a constant talent inflow for all Encode programmes.\n\n2. Education\n\nEncode’s focus on education and making sure it is as accessible as possible to the general web3 community has proven to be a very successful talent and attention acquisition strategy. All of the Encode Club programmes are built on a solid educational element which is taught by either Encode’s in-house teachers or by designated representatives from the project supporting Encode’s initiatives. The result of these sessions, workshops and lessons is then a solid knowledge base and a foundation for developers and programme participants to build upon.\n\n 3. Support\n\nManaging the talent within a programme and making sure participants are engaged and motivated to give their best is something Encode manages to achieve by dedicating manpower towers supporting everyone taking part in their programmes. Multiple programme managers usually spend the majority of their time on keeping in touch with the hackers as well as making sure to schedule several one-on-one calls that help hackers voice concerns, point out specific needs and generally provide more feedback. This technique of constant engagement has proven key to maintaining high levels of active programme participants which then leads to a subsequent high levels of project submissions as well.\n\n 4. Reporting\n\nAnother key point that differentiates Encode Club from their competitors is the neverending attention to detail and data-driven approach which is at the core of all of their activities. Encode partners get to benefit from this, by leveraging pre-existing information on talent taking part of their programmes, identifying the best participants and even directly engaging with them. This approach allows for spotting top hackers and systematically pinpoint top performers even if their current work is their very first engagement with a specific ecosystem.\n\n 5. Engagement\n\nFinishing a programme is anything but the end for a hacker’s journey when it comes to their Encode experience. Encode will make sure to go the extra mile for all participants that have shown exceptional skills and dedication throughout a programme and make sure to follow up and provide support throughout these builders’ web3 journeys. Such may include, but not limited to - introductions to other prominent members of the Encode developer community, providing feedback for future projects, as well as facilitating intros to potential investors.\n\nIV. Proposal\n\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants programme that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\n\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the programme that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the DAO.\n\nEncode is to be allocated $2-5MM for the duration of the grants programme. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards. Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the programme.\n\nV. Reasoning\n\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programmes that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\n\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running Saddle’s successful grants programme , their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a programme of this magnitude.\n\nVI. Past Experience\n\nThe last time Encode was entrusted with running a grant programme was during the early months of 2022 when Saddle delegated the responsibility for running several editions of these to the Encode team. The two installments of the programme proved to be very successful and the young project managed to engage hundreds of developers to explore, build and contribute to their project.\n\n 1. Delegation\n\nEncode shines most prominently when entrusted with handling as many of the intricacies of a given programme as possible. Once general deliverables and goals were outlined by both parties, Encode was then allowed to lead the rest of the programme on its own with regular check-ins and update calls added to the diary in advance. This led to programme specific decisions to be made within Encode based on their team’s expertise, while keeping the sponsors with a hand on the wheel regarding the general direction of the programme itself.\n\n 2. Preparation\n\nMultiple calls were done by both parties in order to properly identify the needs of the sponsor and the extent to which Encode can adjust in order to meet them. The results were carefully crafted tracks of challenges (both technical and non-technical) that were to serve as a guiding point for developers and enthusiasts alike to try and conquer. Example of such were:\n\nTechnical Bounties\n\nFork Saddle code to bring stablecoin swaps to alt chains\n\nApplications and integrations built with/on top of Saddle\n\nStaking functionality on Saddle dApp\n\ndApp dashboard for Saddle LPs\n\nAnalytics for Saddle protocol and pools\n\nNon-technical Bounties\n\nUsability research and user testing\n\nSaddle swag mockups\n\nMemes\n\nSaddle-inspired NFT art\n\nAMAs with your favourite crypto communities\n\nThe challenges proved to be a great mix of both accessible and hard to accomplish, which led to great levels of engagement from both within and outside the Encode community.\n\n 3. Execution\n\nSeries of events were outlined from the get go to keep the public informed and engaged with the developments around the grants programme. With all of them being live, participants had the opportunity to directly engage with both the Saddle and Encode team, ask questions and get support for their projects.\n\nAdditional educational events were included, hosted by Encode with speakers from Saddle, that would provide further depth to the bounties and a proper way to tackle them in a way that would lead to a successful grant allocation. These sessions proved key for keeping the community’s attention high and up-to-date with all latest developments.\n\nLastly, dedicated highlight events were introduced to serve as a show-and-tell for developers and builders, where they would get the chance to present their work in front of the grants team and eventually compete for one. Those event ended up as a fantastic opportunity for grant participants to compare their work and receive constructive feedback from the Saddle team.\n\n 4. Evaluations\n\nOnce the first batch of grants were distributed, the Encode team went through a vigorous evaluation process with the Saddle team. The purpose of this was to maintain a close connection with their team as well as make sure their goals were being met accordingly and standard of the programme and its execution would meet their high expectations.\n\nVII. Success Stories\n\nHaving organised so many successful programmes over the past several years, Encode is proud to have witnessed multiple great stories of hard work, true dedication and subsequent great success. The following are just a few of projects that came to exist through Encode and went on to conquer the heights of the web3 space.\n\n 1. 0xmons\n\nA winner of one of Encode Club’s 2021 hackathons. Known for their distinctive pixel images generated by a GAN, the project proved to be one of the most valuable and well recognized projects of the NFT space even prior to the great boom and NFT movement later that year. Their founder went on to later build a side project, which resulted in being one of the biggest decentralised NFT marketplaces - Sudoswap .\n\n 2. Float Protocol\n\nA hackathon finalist from 2021, Float Protocol stood out with its innovative protocol design for a fully decentralised and non-dollar pegged stablecoin. Challenging the norm of dollar-pegged stablecoins at the time resulted in the protocol capturing the attention of the majority of the DeFi space, which led to the protocol amassing an excess of 1 billion in total value locked upon launch. Their success was soon followed by an investment by DeFi allstars like Stani Kulechov, 0xMaki, MCV and the LAO.\n\n 3. Footium\n\nAfter being selected among the best projects to take part in Encode’s Accelerator programme back in 2020, Footium ended up maturing into one of the finest and most promising NFT games within the space. Their hard work and commitment to creating the best football manager game in the web3 space was widely recognised and soon led to a successful investment led by the London-based VC firm BACKED, as well as others such as Animoca Brands, Stride.VC and YGG.\n\n 4. Euler Finance\n\nA 2020 participant from one of Encode’s earliest Hackathons, Euler was then crowned winner. Their innovative lending protocol idea went through a two-year long development journey, which saw the product finally getting released to the public in early 2022 and is currently being considered one of Aave and Compound’s direct and biggest competitors. Along the way, the team managed to catch the attention of some of the most prominent investors in the space and secure more than $40 million in investments led by Paradigm.\n\nVIII. Process\n\n 1. Outline\n\nEncode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:\n\nBrief summary and explanation\n\nClearly outlined deliverables\n\nExecution and delivery within the timeline of the programme\n\nAmount of funding attached\n\nThere will be two types of bounties:\n\nCompetitions – several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the programme.\n\nAward – a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the programme.\n\nBounties will be listed on the Encode website and public calls for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organise several education events with community members and investors from the Evmos community throughout the bounty period.\n\nTeams then engage in working, building and polishing their projects by the deadline outlined in the programme. The best are to be invited, judged and rewarded in proportion to their efforts and magnitude of impact for the Evmos ecosystem in a show and tell finale events organised by Encode.\n\n 2. Bounties\n\nBounties are to be outlined in advance with the help of both prominent community members as well as the input from the core Evmos team. Different bounties, challenges and tracks may be both added or subtracted throughout the duration of the programme based on the project submissions and subsequent reward allocations.\n\nIn order to properly involve the community, Encode shall create dedicated discord channels for the programme and aggregate all proposals before finalising a complete list of bounties and allocating a portion of the rewards pool for each.\n\n 3. Promotion\n\nEncode will rely heavily on their existing communication and social networking channels including Discord , Medium and Twitter . These have proven successful multiple times in the past by driving organic growth, word of mouth and interest in their programmes. Several representatives of the Encode team shall take care of engaging with prospective participants and work on generating interest towards the programme on a daily basis.\n\n 4. Execution\n\nThis is where Encode Club excels at - with multiple dedicated programme managers, their team can provide unmatched attention to detail and participant support in order to ensure continuous engagement and ensure developers end up fulfilling the potential of the projects and goals they’ve set to accomplish.\n\nDedicated 1-1 calls on a regular basis provide further insight into what teams are doing, what bounties they’re working on as well as the roadblocks they’re encountering. This information is crucial and addressing the team’s input and feedback in time guarantees higher participation numbers and increased submission rates.\n\n 5. Communication\n\nEncode Club will hold regular office hours within their discord for community members, builders and Evmos representatives to join for an unstructured discussion, allowing for people to ask questions, share opinions and voice concerns.\n\n 6. Rewards\n\nRewards will too follow the same pattern as the bounties, with each getting a reward range agreed in advance and subject to change depending on project submissions and allocation of rewards. Rewards will be initiated upon successfully covering the bounty requirements, with the prizes being distributed directly from the DAO treasury and approved by the committee multisig.\n\n 7. Hiring Support\n\nEncode Club is a talent hub and a hiring pipeline for many of its partners. As such, it has dedicated personnel working hard to identify talented individuals, help them fulfill their potential and eventually see them hired or start their own companies within the web3 space. Throughout the grants programme, our talent team will work closely with its participants to try and connect them with like-minded individuals, possessing the qualities they are looking for in order to elevate the level of the project they’re working on. Additionally, they’ll focus on highlighting the best builders to the Evmos team working on exploring employment options for them within the ecosystem.\n\n 8. Iteration\n\nEven though Encode has conducted multiple programmes like these in the past, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge that each of these vary in some respect based on a number of factors such as chain complexities, market conditions, programme-specific intricacies. Therefore, Encode Club shall actively monitor and take both the community’s and the Evmos’ team feedback into account and move swiftly to iterate where needed in order to meet the goals of the grants programme set off to achieve.\n\nIX. Evmos Committee\n\nIn order to ensure transparency and accountability on Encode Club’s side an Evmos Committee shall be formed with representatives from both the community and the Evmos team. It will be in direct communication with Encode and will have power to challenge their decisions along the way.\n\nFurthermore a multisig controlling the funds associated with the grants programme shall be formed that may or may not consist of the same members as the committee. The purpose of the multisig is to be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos.\n\nWith the help of the Evmos team, Encode Club will release a call to action to the Evmos community in an attempt to promote the chance to be on the Evmos committee and multisig for this programme. Exact execution and steps towards the creation of the committee will be finalised if the programme is to be approved from the DAO.\n\nX. Costs Breakdown\n\nFurthermore a multisig controlling the funds associated with the grants programme shall be formed that may or may not consist of the same members as the committee. The purpose of the multisig is to be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos.\n\nEncode is a 25 person team and will be putting significant effort across multiple departments and individuals. The following is a rough outline of the costs associated with the proper execution of the grants pilot programme.\n\nMarketing and Sourcing: $10k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nProgramme Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nGrant Team Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nBook-keeping, Finances + Admin: $2.5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\nHiring support for any grantees: $5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\nTech and Infrastructure: $2.5k per month\n\nThis brings the total monthly cost of running the programme to $50k. The amount is to be invoiced in advance prior every month and deducted from the total grant size allocated for the program execution.\n\nXI. Conclusion\n\nEncode Club’s plan is to make this proposal available to the public for early evaluation and feedback by the end of December with the possibility of putting it to a vote in early January. If successful, Encode will be able to start executing as early as mid/late January.\n\nGathering bounty proposals from both the community and the Evmos team will begin immediately after approval. The marketing team will switch focus on promoting the grant programme, while also turning the attention of Encode’s existing Cosmos and Evmos hackers within the community to the upcoming event.\n\nGrant applicants will work closely with Encode Club’s programme managers throughout the duration of the program in order to ensure that their work follows the guidelines and meets the requirements outlined by the bounties in order to qualify for a grant. Encode will impose deadlines for project submissions, after which the best builders will be invited to present their work live and compete for a prize from the grants pool.\n\nEncode activities will remain under the constant supervision of the Evmos committee at all times and transactions will be executed via the trusted multisig.\n\nXII. FAQ\n\nThis is a big commitment/investment for the community - what happens if the quality of the projects submitted is not as high as the grants put aside for the programme?\n\nThe grants budget will never leave the Evmos Committee Multisig. It’s just a number that the DAO will be willing to deploy if the project submissions end up satisfying the requirements outlined by the programme. All unused funds will remain in the multisig and/or returned directly to the DAO for utilisation in other projects.\n\nWho is going to be controlling these funds?\n\nAn Evmos committee will be formed to govern the funds and approve expenditures. It will be composed (ideally) by prominent community members, trusted team members as well as validators.\n\nHow is the Evmos community going to be involved in this?\n\nThe Evmos community can help with providing ideas for structuring the grant programmes and help identifying key areas that should be addressed by the challenges. Additionally, certain representatives may be invited to join the governing body that will be overseeing the execution of the programme.\n\nWhy Encode and not someone else?\n\nEncode Club is one of the most experienced web3 education communities with a proven track record of successful high level execution of a wide range of programmes. With a numerous and strong chain-agnosting developer community they are an ideal candidate for a programme of the magnitude and importance of the Evmos grants.\n\nIs the programme going to a public one? How easy will it be for the community to follow or get involved?\n\nEncode Club will host regular public events for both informational and educational purposes, the purpose of which will be to help potential participants to get to know the best ways to become involved, submit a project and win a grant.\n\nWho gets to decide which projects get to receive grants?\n\nEncode club will rely on pre-defined and outlined criteria for picking grant winners. Once such are identified, they will be passed on to the Evmos committee along with the grants that Encode has suggested for allocation. If approved by the committee, the grants size will be deducted from the grants budget in the Committee Multisig.\n\nWhat happens to open grantees in the event of Encode’s programme not being renewed past the initial period?\n\nEncode Club will construct windows for grants being awarded such that if the programme is terminated after the initial 6 months, there will be no outstanding grants. For teams awarded within that 6 months, we will continue to provide support (unless asked otherwise) for a period of 3 months.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-19T12:43:36.434Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1cz7nm0hfagxhxffvkp89amecpk2kpkxy2cu8vw\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Encode Club\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Web3 Education Community\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/7e8a4db8-29d2-4c1d-a8fd-39eb58bdf303.png\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-16T17:23:18.559Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Encode Club’s Evmos Grants Proposal\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"I.

Secret Sauce\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"the means\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\\\\n\\\\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse. Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\\\\n\\\\nEnsuring and maintaining the level of talent is a continuous task. The following are some of the implemented techniques and approaches that keeps the talent bar high and rising.\\\\n\\\\n             \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1. Sourcing\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA significant amount of time and work is invested in making sure the best developers within a given ecosystem are both identified and made aware of an upcoming programme. To achieve this, the Encode team is keeping a close eye on every single event within the web3 space and tries to identify promising teams and projects alike. Getting in touch with them and inviting them to our own programme where they’ll be given a stage to perform and compete for great prizes is a priority. Furthermore, Encode Club is in direct communication with the majority of university blockchain clubs in existence around the world. Ensuring a close and warm bond with these societies contributes to a constant talent inflow for all Encode programmes. \\\\n\\\\n             \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"2. Education\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEncode’s focus on education and making sure it is as accessible as possible to the general web3 community has proven to be a very successful talent and attention acquisition strategy. All of the Encode Club programmes are built on a solid educational element which is taught by either Encode’s in-house teachers or by designated representatives from the project supporting Encode’s initiatives. The result of these sessions, workshops and lessons is then a solid knowledge base and a foundation for developers and programme participants to build upon.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             3. Support\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nManaging the talent within a programme and making sure participants are engaged and motivated to give their best is something Encode manages to achieve by dedicating manpower towers supporting everyone taking part in their programmes. Multiple programme managers usually spend the majority of their time on keeping in touch with the hackers as well as making sure to schedule several one-on-one calls that help hackers voice concerns, point out specific needs and generally provide more feedback. This technique of constant engagement has proven key to maintaining high levels of active programme participants which then leads to a subsequent high levels of project submissions as well.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             4. Reporting\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnother key point that differentiates Encode Club from their competitors is the neverending attention to detail and data-driven approach which is at the core of all of their activities. Encode partners get to benefit from this, by leveraging pre-existing information on talent taking part of their programmes, identifying the best participants and even directly engaging with them. This approach allows for spotting top hackers and systematically pinpoint top performers even if their current work is their very first engagement with a specific ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             5. Engagement\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFinishing a programme is anything but the end for a hacker’s journey when it comes to their Encode experience. Encode will make sure to go the extra mile for all participants that have shown exceptional skills and dedication throughout a programme and make sure to follow up and provide support throughout these builders’ web3 journeys. Such may include, but not limited to - introductions to other prominent members of the Encode developer community, providing feedback for future projects, as well as facilitating intros to potential investors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IV. Proposal\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants programme that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\\\\n\\\\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the programme that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the DAO.\\\\n\\\\nEncode is to be allocated $2-5MM for the duration of the grants programme. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards. Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the programme.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"V. Reasoning\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programmes that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\\\\n\\\\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://medium.com/encode-club/bounties4bandits-the-bandits-have-saddled-up-39c2ae45f676\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle’s successful grants programme\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\", their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a programme of this magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nVI. Past Experience\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe last time Encode was entrusted with running a grant programme was during the early months of 2022 when Saddle delegated the responsibility for running several editions of these to the Encode team. The two installments of the programme proved to be very successful and the young project managed to engage hundreds of developers to explore, build and contribute to their project.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             1. Delegation\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEncode shines most prominently when entrusted with handling as many of the intricacies of a given programme as possible. Once general deliverables and goals were outlined by both parties, Encode was then allowed to lead the rest of the programme on its own with regular check-ins and update calls added to the diary in advance. This led to programme specific decisions to be made within Encode based on their team’s expertise, while keeping the sponsors with a hand on the wheel regarding the general direction of the programme itself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             2. Preparation\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMultiple calls were done by both parties in order to properly identify the needs of the sponsor and the extent to which Encode can adjust in order to meet them. The results were carefully crafted tracks of challenges (both technical and non-technical) that were to serve as a guiding point for developers and enthusiasts alike to try and conquer. Example of such were:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Technical Bounties\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nFork Saddle code to bring stablecoin swaps to alt chains\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Applications and integrations built with/on top of Saddle\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Staking functionality on Saddle dApp\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"dApp dashboard for Saddle LPs\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Analytics for Saddle protocol and pools\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Non-technical Bounties\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nUsability research and user testing\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle swag mockups\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Memes\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle-inspired NFT art\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"AMAs with your favourite crypto communities\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe challenges proved to be a great mix of both accessible and hard to accomplish, which led to great levels of engagement from both within and outside the Encode community.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             3. Execution\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSeries of events were outlined from the get go to keep the public informed and engaged with the developments around the grants programme. With all of them being live, participants had the opportunity to directly engage with both the Saddle and Encode team, ask questions and get support for their projects.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional educational events were included, hosted by Encode with speakers from Saddle, that would provide further depth to the bounties and a proper way to tackle them in a way that would lead to a successful grant allocation. These sessions proved key for keeping the community’s attention high and up-to-date with all latest developments.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, dedicated highlight events were introduced to serve as a show-and-tell for developers and builders, where they would get the chance to present their work in front of the grants team and eventually compete for one. Those event ended up as a fantastic opportunity for grant participants to compare their work and receive constructive feedback from the Saddle team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             4. Evaluations\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOnce the first batch of grants were distributed, the Encode team went through a vigorous evaluation process with the Saddle team. The purpose of this was to maintain a close connection with their team as well as make sure their goals were being met accordingly and standard of the programme and its execution would meet their high expectations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"VII. Success Stories\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nHaving organised so many successful programmes over the past several years, Encode is proud to have witnessed multiple great stories of hard work, true dedication and subsequent great success.

by Carbon protocol, Nitron is a decentralized non-custodial money market where users can participate as depositors (lenders), borrowers or liquidators permissionlessly.

is aimed at checking community sentiment and starting discussion around amending the initial Galaxe Campaign proposal, and to fund this initiative to help support current and future builders on Evmos. The original proposal did not pass, but after further discussion there has been interest signaled to try this again with adjustments. The main goal of the Galxe campaign initiative is to give Evmos builders more resources, and provide an engaging opportunity to gain new users.\n\nThe Galxe campaigns will not only grab the attention of new users to explore Evmos, but this will become a tool for current and future builders to utilize to help gain exposure for their projects and reach their growth targets. Once integrated, any new project on Evmos in the future can run their own campaign. Here is a list of projects/teams that have signaled interest and that would be able to participate in this campaign:\n\nOrbital Apes\n\nDiffusion\n\nSpaceFi\n\nC14\n\nKinesis\n\nSaddle Finance\n\nHadron Finance\n\nMidas Capital\n\nBridges (Satellite, Celer, Gravity)\n\nEarnmos\n\nEvmos Domains\n\nTaking into account community concerns and the current environment, this temperature check will make TWO main amendment:\n\nThe total ask will be reduced to $100K in EVMOS tokens. Please use the poll to show if you support this amount or not.\n\nThe tokens distributed from this initial campaign are not distributed until campaign completion, but to ease concerns about \"Airdrop Hunters\" these tokens will be distributed over a 3-6 month period, similar to a vesting schedule\n\nAs you can see in the original proposal below, these campaigns are designed by each individual team that are geared towards their individual growth needs on and off chain. This is FREE for builders to use, and the Galxe team is waiving all integration costs. This would be the start of a long term relationship with the Galxe team that will provide a long term resource for builders in the Evmos ecosystem. All of these tokens will end up in the hands of users, and only after going through and exploring the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nPlease review the proposal below with supporting details on previous campaigns they've done, review the previous linked thread with community input, use the polls here to communicate intention, and please provide any and all feedback you may have.\n\nThis will not go on chain unless we receive clear signal and overwhelming support, so please express your opinion no matter what your thoughts are.\n\nReposting the proposal from the Galxe team :\n\nSummary\n\nThe Galxe team proposes allocating $100K USD in EVMOS  to fund targeted campaigns and initiatives that provides Evmos with exposure to new users and drives organic growth on-chain. Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so.  These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well.  With a large portion of the Rektdrop  being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.\n\nThese funds will be sent to a multisig comprised of Evmos community members and Validators to ensure accountability for the distribution of funds. (TBD)\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nMotivation\n\nGalxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users.  Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)\n\nDiffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:\n\nFollowing socials (Twitter/Discord)\n\nRetweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet\n\nMake a swap\n\nProvide liquidity\n\nBuy an NFT and hold for X amount of time\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem\n\nIntroduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses  to the Evmos ecosystemIntroduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing powerJoint AMA’s\n\nBlog post\n\nRetweets\n\nQuote Tweets\n\nTweets all throughout the campaign\n\nDiscord/Telegram communication\n\nCampaign featured on our main carousel [see: https://galxe.com/campaigns ]\n\nEngage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem\n\nEducate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns\n\nProblems a Galxe campaign addresses\n\nStagnant growth to the ecosystem\n\nLack of new users\n\nAbsence of engagement\n\nLow exposure\n\nValue that Galxe can add\n\nDrive new, quality users  into the ecosystem from a new web3 audience that Evmos has not had exposure to yet\n\nIncrease TVL and transaction volume  on Evmos for long term growth\n\nDiscord and Twitter  tools to engage off chain\n\nOn chain tools to create on chain loyalty programs\n\nPast experience  with similar campaigns that include Arbitrum, Solana, Optimism, and Moonbeam\n\nBring users from other EVM and non EVM chains  to the ecosystem\n\nConvert new users into long term, loyal users  of the Evmos ecosystem\n\nExperts  in on chain and off chain growth\n\nStrong marketing power and exposure  from Galxe’s socials and network Twitter : 504K+ (Verified)\n\nDiscord : 295K +Co Marketing Galxe can provide:Joint AMA’s\n\nBlog post\n\nRetweet\n\nQuote Tweet\n\nTweets all throughout the campaign\n\nDiscord/Telegram communication\n\nCampaign featured on our main carousel [see: https://galxe.com/campaigns ]\n\nOverall ask and where the funds will go\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nThe overall ask is for Evmos to put together an ecosystem campaign on Galxe similar to the likes of the Optimism Quest, Solana’s “2022 is gonna be Sol Cool”, Arbitrum Odyssey, and Moonbeam’s Ultimate Harvest Moon Campaign'' all hosted and coordinated by Galxe. The funds allocated to this campaign will go to the community members who participate in this campaign and not to Galxe.  A scoring system will be put in place for the users who collect all or the majority of badges throughout the campaign. The more NFTs you collect the more you will be rewarded.\n\nhttps://galxe.com/polygon/campaign/GCNWwUwJBT\n\nTwitter Space Credential Badges claimed after attending a Twitter Space\n\nhttps://galxe.com/ZetaChain/campaign/GCcGZUtnHZ\n\nTwitter/Discord Credential 169K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://galxe.com/HopProtocol/campaign/GCmydUtumN\n\nNFT for bridging ETH over to Arbitrum 240K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GChMBUtwGc\n\nNFTs for swapping into specific tokens with a minimum $USD on ODOS DEX 516K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://docs.galxe.com/case-studies/DEXGrowthWithHashflow\n\nHashflow DEX Case Study On chain growth from 3,000 - 13,000+ users in 6 weeksTrading volume went from $19.8M - $673M in 6 weeks\n\nhttps://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6HiUtSAs\n\nStargate Bridge Campaign in Optimism Quest 60K+ NFTs Minted\n\nAbout Galxe\n\nIn 2021, Galxe was formed by Bullet Labs  and has seen substantial growth on numerous fronts. Charles Wayn and Harry Zhang co-founded Galxe and previously founded the blockchain streaming service, DLive, where they successfully exited in 2019 after a sale to BitTorrent.\n\nSince inception, Galxe has raised $10M from top VC funds around the globe, had an oversubscribed public sale on CoinList, and launched the $GAL token in May on the majority of tier 1 CEX’s which included Binance and Coinbase  on the first day. Their latest financing round was led by Dragonfly and Multicoin Capital . Most recently, Galxe was awarded the 2022 Binance Launchpool Project of The Year Award.\n\nGalxe has extensive experience in putting together ecosystem campaigns and has delivered superior results  for each ecosystem we’ve partnered with. Running an ecosystem campaign on Galxe comes with incredible co-marketing opportunities that include Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Joint AMA’s, Blog post, and Campaigns featured on our main carousel.\n\nPrevious Ecosystem Campaigns\n\nSolana’s “2022 is Sol Cool” Campaign\n\nSolana’s ecosystem  added 33,400 new users with each unique user trying an average of 5 protocols on Solana and 4,826 users completing 10 or more tasks from different partners.\n\nCampaign page views for duration of campaign:  1,233,416\n\nUsers (unique visitor for duration of campaign):  336,313\n\nNFT Minted:  130,503\n\n**Blog post by Galxe: **https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-presents-2022-is-gonna-be-sol-cool-6445c43a942c\n\n**Case Study: **https://docs.galxe.com/case-studies/EcosystemGrowthWithSolana\n\nGalxe Blog Post for Solana Campaign: https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-presents-2022-is-gonna-be-sol-cool-6445c43a942c\n\n(image)\n\nArbitrum Odyssey\n\nCampaign page views until 10/13/2022:  2,256,041\n\nUsers (unique visitor):  394,992\n\nNFT Minted  420,401 until pause for Nitro (Arbitrum network upgrade) one week in\n\nBlog post by Galxe: https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-teams-up-for-arbitrum-odyssey-104e07edcdc9\n\nCampaign page: https://galxe.com/arbitrum/campaign/GCCNzUtQiW\n\nOptimism Quest\n\nCampaign page views until 11/08/2022:  1,010,701\n\nUsers (unique visitor):  64,938\n\nNFT Minted  553,524 to date\n\nBlog post by Galxe: https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-x-optimism-optimism-quests-f060c139d660\n\nCampaign Page: https://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6xiUtedg\n\nStargate transactions  after beginning the OP Quest (graphic taken on 9/21)\n\n(image)\n\n(image)\n\nGalxe + OP Twitter Spaces Announcement Tweet\n\n(image)\n\nThe Ultimate Harvest Moon Campaign (Moonbeam)\n\nCampaign page views  from 7/28 - 8/11: 214,287\n\nUsers (unique visitor):  48,376\n\nNFT Minted:  41,567\n\nCampaign  is paused because of the Nomad hack on Moonbeam\n\nBlog post by Galxe:\n\nhttps://blog.galxe.com/the-ultimate-harvest-moon-campaign-97d41c5d2f48\n\nCampaign Page: https://galxe.com/Moonbeam/campaign/GCcg1Ut2hD\n\nGalxe Twitter announcement  tweet of Moonbeam campaign\n\n(image)\n\nFunding Request\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nGalxe is requesting a rewards pool of $100K USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members.  We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign.  Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.\n\nThe campaign structure would typically be throughout a number of weeks depending on how many dApps participate. The community can always be extended and more dApps can join in. Users will complete simple on-chain and off-chain tasks on each dapp such as Twitter/Discord actions and swapping, farming, staking, bridging, LP, etc. Evmos can choose to pick the participating dApps itself or can allow the community to vote and choose the participating dApps. The campaign can be structured in the two following ways:\n\nThroughout the duration of the campaign users will have the ability to engage with two dApps per week  and the following week an additional two dApps will become available for users to engage with. Arbitrum is operating their quest like this and we’ve seen success with this structure.\n\nAll dApps part of the quest will be available  for users to engage with throughout the duration of the campaign. Optimism is operating their quest like this. This could be useful for DeFi protocols if you want users to stake or provide liquidity for a month or longer\n\nGaxle has the ability to implement sybil prevention credentials to make sure rewards are not diluted to bots and users with multiple wallets. We currently have the following credentials available\n\nhttps://galxe.com/credential/207415643290116096 Has at least 30 transactions on Ethereum mainnet after Ethereum Merge\n\nhttps://galxe.com/credential/187770474584514560 Has at least 10 transaction on Ethereum mainnet\n\nWe have the ability to set up credentials that include hold X (.1, .25, .5) amount of ETH on Ethereum\n\nWe’re excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with the Evmos community, and leverage our current user base to help with the on-chain growth of the ecosystem. We encourage feedback from the community to ensure we’ve addressed any questions or concerns, so we gain resounding support for this proposal.\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-14T21:34:02.234Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos14rsst0wnenhpxqv0drtvmz5jegp2dtcpf0srcl\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Tricky | Cosmos Spaces\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-26T19:51:40.746Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Background\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis is aimed at checking community sentiment and starting discussion around amending the initial Galaxe Campaign proposal, and to fund this initiative to help support current and future builders on Evmos. The original proposal did not pass, but after further discussion there has been interest signaled to try this again with adjustments. The main goal of the Galxe campaign initiative is to give Evmos builders more resources, and provide an engaging opportunity to gain new users.\\\\n\\\\nThe Galxe campaigns will not only grab the attention of new users to explore Evmos, but this will become a tool for current and future builders to utilize to help gain exposure for their projects and reach their growth targets.

[https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8496-bring-quasar-to-evmos-execute-cosmos-transactions-queries-from-the-evm-from-any-smart-contract](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8496-bring-quasar-to-evmos-execute-cosmos-transactions-queries-from-the-evm-from-any-smart-contract)\n\nWe made this idea public for Evmos in July 2022, along with a first demo prototype, for the Evmos community.\n\nNow we have a full implementation of the core features.\n\n## Features:\n\n1. Stateful precompiles brought to Ethermint. This includes maintaining a fork of go-ethereum with changes that offer precompiles the same functionality as normal smart contracts. \n2. Both EOA accounts and EVM contracts can execute Cosmos transactions and Cosmos Queries from inside the EVM.\n3. Developers have access to a Solidity-compatible library that makes it easy to create Cosmos messages & queries from any smart contract.\n4. This tech is unique. No other chain has it other than Mythos, a chain without tradeable currency. Ethereum cannot perform such transactions and Cosmos chains either. This is pure synergy between EVM and Cosmos.\n\n## Usecases\n\n- next-gen decentralized governance: having access to Cosmos gov module data from the EVM, will power real dGov on Evmos, based on actual staking data.\n- Evmos-native liquid staking\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- go-ethereum work from https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26119#issuecomment-1305908559, specifically [these changes](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...loredanacirstea:go-ethereum:loredana/extensible-precompiles). This enabled Quasar to be called from smart contracts and not only from EOA accounts.\n- I built the Quasar precompile on top of the stateless precompile abstraction stub implemented in Ethermint by Federico Kunze: https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272\n- I efficiently synchronized Cosmos & EVM execution context frames\n- I aligned the Cosmos execution context frame to be reverted or committed to the final state by EVM's StateDB\n- the Cosmos execution context frame can account correctly for the state and gas metering of all its children frames.\n- like any other contract or precompile, Quasar supports call, delegatecall (behaves like call), and staticcall\n- on top of the above, the Solidity-compatible library & ABI encoding/decoding features can be added, so that Cosmos messages & queries can be constructed from a smart contract.\n\n## Demos\n\nDemo video, to understand quasar: https://youtu.be/COu5Olszhtg.\n\nQuasar is available for testing, on [Mythos](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/943428722d7715ecd95cba702bde1be5cc5a06b1/mythos/chain.json). Technical documentation for testing can be found [here](https://github.com/the-laurel/demos/tree/main/docs/precompiles/Quasar).\n\n[Other quasar demo videos.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL323JufuD9JB1R28TdzCtiiIwTHy9TX5C)\n\n## Timeline\n\nFeatures 1 & 2 are done. Feature 3 is partially done.\nWe can deliver a production-ready quasar in 2 weeks and then assist the Evmos Core/Tharsis team to integrate it into their release schedule.\n\n\n## Author\n\nLoredana Cirstea. Independent core contributor to Evmos and Ethermint. Building for the EVM since 2017. Detailed contributions for my former volunteer efforts [here](https://evolve.provable.dev/).

Stateful precompiles brought to Ethermint. This includes maintaining a fork of go-ethereum with changes that offer precompiles the same functionality as normal smart contracts. \\n2. Both EOA accounts and EVM contracts can execute Cosmos transactions and Cosmos Queries from inside the EVM.\\n3. Developers have access to a Solidity-compatible library that makes it easy to create Cosmos messages & queries from any smart contract.\\n4. This tech is unique. No other chain has it other than Mythos, a chain without tradeable currency. Ethereum cannot perform such transactions and Cosmos chains either. This is pure synergy between EVM and Cosmos.\\n\\n## Usecases\\n\\n- next-gen decentralized governance: having access to Cosmos gov module data from the EVM, will power real dGov on Evmos, based on actual staking data.\\n- Evmos-native liquid staking\\n\\n## Technical Details\\n\\n- go-ethereum work from https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26119#issuecomment-1305908559, specifically [these changes](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...loredanacirstea:go-ethereum:loredana/extensible-precompiles). This enabled Quasar to be called from smart contracts and not only from EOA accounts.\\n- I built the Quasar precompile on top of the stateless precompile abstraction stub implemented in Ethermint by Federico Kunze: https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272\\n- I efficiently synchronized Cosmos & EVM execution context frames\\n- I aligned the Cosmos execution context frame to be reverted or committed to the final state by EVM's StateDB\\n- the Cosmos execution context frame can account correctly for the state and gas metering of all its children frames.\\n- like any other contract or precompile, Quasar supports call, delegatecall (behaves like call), and staticcall\\n- on top of the above, the Solidity-compatible library & ABI encoding/decoding features can be added, so that Cosmos messages & queries can be constructed from a smart contract.\\n\\n## Demos\\n\\nDemo video, to understand quasar: https://youtu.be/COu5Olszhtg.\\n\\nQuasar is available for testing, on [Mythos](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/943428722d7715ecd95cba702bde1be5cc5a06b1/mythos/chain.json). Ping us for MYT tokens for testing.\\n\\n[Other quasar demo videos.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL323JufuD9JB1R28TdzCtiiIwTHy9TX5C)\\n\\n## Timeline\\n\\nFeatures 1 & 2 are done. Feature 3 is partially done.\\nWe can deliver a production-ready quasar in 2 weeks and then assist the Evmos Core/Tharsis team to integrate it into their release schedule.\\n\\n\\n## Author\\n\\nLoredana Cirstea. Core contributor to Evmos and Ethermint. Building for the EVM since 2017. Detailed contributions for my former volunteer efforts [here](https://evolve.provable.dev/). Quasar was ideated and implemented by The Laurel Project team.\\n\\n\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-12-13T17:02:43.863Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T12:14:02.505Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-23T12:14:02.505Z","Address":{"id":48221,"address":"evmos17ucx8wx9mz9f2a4ccum536gthydprcumuchveh","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-07-31T18:07:19.415Z","keytype":null,"name":"Loredana","last_active":"2022-12-21T21:47:32.053Z","user_id":37231,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":34514,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":37231},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1160,"name":"3.

Easily readable, with a clear layout (plus videos).\n\nSimple explanation of MetaTank - https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1605612305542045696\n\nIf you’d like further details, please check our PDF doc and Gitbook, links here:\n\nPDF - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRPwv3yaICEBPbOfyuJMaMjB_LnzYp7n/view?usp=sharing\n\nGITBOOK - https://metatank.gitbook.io/metatank/metatank/introduction\n\nNow, we will present what MetaTank is about, what we aim to do & how we can help grow Evmos (liquidity + users).\n\nIMPORTANT: We are not building on-chain web3 games. There is no Metaverse. We are not including NFTs. No tokens are required to play our games. We are building web2 mobile games (think Subway Surfer for example).\n\nProof of Capabilities:\n\nMinting - https://twitter.com/KayzMtnk/status/1597694274346573824\n\nIn-game wallet - https://twitter.com/KayzMtnk/status/1597697148057157632\n\nBattle System - https://twitter.com/KayzMtnk/status/1597699452562997248\n\nConversion Platform - https://twitter.com/KayzMtnk/status/1597701006774894594\n\nHow Evmos Community Benefits:\n\nRevenues from mobile games injected into Evmos (conversion rewards).\n\nUsers must enter Evmos to use Conversion Platform.\n\nOnboarding web2 game developers (with their userbase/IP) via Conversion Platform.\n\n10% of $MTNK supply reserved for Evmos community.\n\nDirecting the userbase amassed by MetaTank, promoting Evmos and its ecosystem projects.\n\nValue proposition (lite): https://discord.com/channels/809048090249134080/913597332073898034/1053286938750234704\n\nBrief History\n\nThe idea of MetaTank spawned at the height of the GameFi craze in October 2021. We were just a group of blockchain and gaming enthusiasts.\n\nIt all turned out to be financial products dressed as gaming products. All dependent on token prices. It became a racket. Weekly launches, games loaded and shilled by presalers ready to dump, it was disheartening.\n\nWeb3 games built a large barrier for Web2 gamers to overcome:\n\n- Setup a wallet.\n\n- Signup to an exchange.\n\n- Purchase Tokens/NFTs.\n\nMultiple actions required before users can even begin to play.\n\nThis was not gaming. This was not MetaTank. We sought something different.\n\nOur first Entry – Theatre of War.\n\nThis is just a showcase of our capabilities. Not what we will be building.\n\nSelf-funded, we raised around $70k and built our first game.\n\nTrailer - https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600981858661326848\n\nImpressive for the amount of resources we had. Loaded with several features. Fairly challenging gameplay mechanics that require strategy. A lot more complex than simply using RNG.\n\nYou can see here – https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600981867485806593\n\nHowever, Theatre of War still based on old Web3 principals.\n\nWith our capabilities, we want to bring a fresh new look at gaming to Evmos.\n\nProject MetaTank\n\nMetaTank a series of games based around a gameverse (think Marvel Universe but for games).\n\nGritty, dystopian. Technologically advanced societies, resource-scarcity and overt/covert power-struggles.\n\n Our Plan (Utilizing our Conversion Platform):\n\nTo create a portfolio of mobile games and generate revenues (Ads/IAPs)\n\nPour revenues into Evmos (rewards) and further game development.\n\nOnboard Web2 game developers onto Evmos, via our Conversion Platform.\n\nBuild a franchise and strong IP.\n\nA key driver behind our approach is our Conversion Platform – https://twitter.com/KayzMtnk/status/1597701006774894594\n\nConversion Platform - Allows users to convert in-game rewards into on-chain tokens. To do so, they must enter Evmos.\n\nHow the process works - For Users\n\n1 - Download a MetaTank mobile game on any appstore. Play like any normal game (think Flappy Bird) and win in-game points.\n\n2 - Leave it at that or convert in-game points into Conversion Currency.\n\n3 - Go on to the Conversion Platform, link their Metamask account + Game account and swap the Conversion Currency for $MTNK.\n\n4 - With on-chain (Evmos) $MTNK tokens, user can sell or interact with the Evmos ecosystem (provide liquidity, build a portfolio).\n\nMobile gaming\n\nJust a quick primer, no stats overload. Mobile Gaming is a behemoth, it continues to grow.\n\nEveryone spends hours on their phones. All genders and ages now game on their mobiles.\n\nMobile gaming landscape - https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600983442648272898\n\nTwo types of mobile games are dominating, in terms of downloads and revenue.\n\nHypercasual/casual games – Downloads\n\nStrategy/RPG games – Revenue\n\nEach with their own benefits (Key Comparisons Table) – https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600984818179018752\n\nStrategy\n\nWe aim to build a portfolio of Hypercasual games.\n\nEach game will be: stream friendly, lore-based and fun.\n\nBuilt with a 3-currency system (creating incentives) - https://metatank.gitbook.io/metatank/games/mobile-gaming/hypercasual-games\n\nOver time, we will proceed to work on more complex Strategy/RPG games, to strengthen our IP.\n\nOn strategy – https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600984809807171584\n\nGaming concepts – https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600986152508436480\n\nOf the revenues we generate, they will be distributed between:\n\nRewards Liquidity Pool - Buying MTNK tokens to keep the pool balanced.\n\nGame development - Reinvesting into building and marketing more games.\n\nExpected revenues\n\nExpected earnings are always fluctuating and vary depending on many factors such as geography.\n\nBrief explanation of revenues – https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1600987744179666945\n\nOur games will be optimized to blend rewarded ads into gameplay. Some will offer surveys (great additional revenue).\n\nUsing a low figure ARPDAU of $0.03, for our Hypercasual games. 1k users (a very small number for a hypercasual) can bring in $900 in revenue, monthly.\n\nBy further optimizing for our rewarded ads and including IAPs.

Overview:\n\nIn line with previous proposal to kickstart DeFi on Evmos , we’re proposing that Evmos governance helps provide 250k Evmos in liquidity mining incentives and a 100k deposit of wEVMOS into Hadron, a lending protocol on Evmos.\n\nPlan of Action:\n\nEvmos has recognized the need to increase the DeFi activity on Evmos in anticipation for the decrease of staking rewards.\n\nWe think that there’s an interesting opportunity at the intersection of the EVM and Cosmos, tapping both the battle proven models of DeFi, with the hundreds of millions in Cosmos DeFi assets.\n\nWith Diffusion kicking off the influx of TVL and DeFi activity on Evmos, the next logical step is to boost a lending protocol built on top of Evmos to continue the flywheel effects.\n\nA lending protocol is key as it’s heavily synergistic with other protocols on Evmos:\n\nDepositing stables and borrowing Evmos allows for delta neutral farming on Diffusion\n\nA stable pool with cTokens allows for LPs to collect lending yield in addition to swap fees on Kinesis\n\nThe listing of various assets (including Juno, Atom, and Osmosis) encourages the bridging of these assets\n\nTo this end, we’re in discussion with potential partners, and have already announced a partnership with Kinesis , the leading stableswap on Evmos.\n\nKinesis will provide rewards to cToken pairs, enabling the 2nd use case described.\n\nFor more typical users, we can expect that the following use cases:\n\nthe ability to earn lending yield on their Evmos (and stEvmos)\n\nliquidity for holders of WEVMOS (and eventually stEVMOS) without selling\n\nthe ability to short tokens (especially for Cosmos tokens)\n\nWe believe that the primary use case will be a strong driver of supply/TVL as a way for users to earn strong yields from both staking and lending.\n\nFor our testnet alone, hundreds of users have used our protocol for deposits and borrows of various assets.\n\nEvmos DAO deposit\n\nWe’re also seeking an additional deposit of 100k EVMOS to deposit into the protocol. This will allow Evmos DAO to accrue both interest fees, Hadron tokens, and further bootstrap the protocol.\n\nThis is an initial small allocation to get the Evmos DAO comfortable with Hadron’s safety along with PoL, especially as we plan on scaling up our ask in a succeeding governance proposal.\n\nThis will be managed by the current multisig controlling Hadron as the safety of Hadron is proven in the market, and is significantly more cost effective in driving liquidity than just liquidity mining.\n\nSince this is a deposit, Evmos DAO controls can choose to withdraw, and opens up possibilities for borrowing other assets for either funding DAO activities or providing liquidity to other protocols in the ecosystem – of which we have several ideas for.\n\nLiquidity Mining\n\n250k EVMOS tokens designated for Hadron to incentivize both borrowing and lending over one month, managed by a multisig consisting of the Hadron team, Orbital Apes, and other members from the Evmos Community.\n\nWe will be using the rewards distributor baked into Compound to increase rewards for each pair as they increase or decrease in TVL, with the focus being on rewards for borrowing and lending of WEVMOS.\n\nThe makeup will be as follows:\n\n40% WEVMOS lending and borrowing\n\n30% Bridged stablecoins\n\n20% Cosmos Assets\n\n10% Bridged Majors (WETH, WBTC)\n\nWe plan on scaling up the ask for the liquidity mining program 2 months into the program, with a goal of building up trust for the Evmos DAO, along with providing an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the liquidity mining program.\n\nThe below spreadsheet contains details for how we would expect the initial grant + scaled up distribution to be deployed as.\n\nDistribution will be front loaded, in order to bootstrap the protocol, although we predict that native protocol revenue will sustain the TVL as time continues.\n\nSee below sheet for distribution details along with expected milestones.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NfQ9On7KG1ageXhfRYhE-krErKu1JFpfjGZkPgr3a28/edit#gid=0\n\nSafety:\n\nWe’re conscious of safety and will have WEVMOS, JUNO, OSMO, ATOM, Axelar, Celer, and Gravity bridged assets with conservative LTVs as borrowable assets.\n\nIf we feel a bridge is unsafe, we will work towards either reducing LTVs, or removing protocol assets all together.\n\nWe've also secured an audit , and will have a bug bounty program in the coming weeks.\n\nAbout Hadron Finance:\n\nHadron based on the Cream Finance protocol, which itself is based on the Compound V2 codebase. We’re currently deployed to Evmos Testnet, and are planning on launching to Evmos Mainnet in the coming weeks.\n\nWe’ve integrated the Adrastia oracle for price feeds, which queries prices and checks on chain liquidity for the most optimal pricing.\n\nThe Hadron team is composed of experienced DeFi users who have both run multi million dollar protocols on other chains and have extensively used DeFi.\n\nDr.Kinesis, the founder of Kinesis Labs, is involved as an advisor for strategy and protocol development.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nFor our roadmap, outside of the launch in the coming weeks, we plan on adding more assets (including Cosmos assets), and partnering with other protocols on Evmos to increase the synergies between Hadron and the rest of the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTo this end, we've already partnered with Kinesis, Celer, Axelar, Gravity, and have several others on the way.\n\nWe plan on having a token to allow for maximal decentralization and allow for full community control of the protocol and parameters, but these details will be solidified at a later date.\n\nThe current plan is to airdrop a nontransferrable token in order to bootstrap a governance set, and emit these

the hundreds of millions in Cosmos DeFi assets.\\\\nWith Diffusion kicking off the influx of TVL and DeFi activity on Evmos, the next logical step is to boost a lending protocol built on top of Evmos

starting this thread to discuss a potential proposal to set up and test a grants initiative geared at addressing 2 main challenges: 1) identifying the needs of the ecosystem and 2) sourcing, onboarding and funding projects to address these needs.\n\n@Sheran and I had previously started a discussion about a project called the Orb . In exchanging with more members of the community, we understood that while this funding mechanism is novel and promising, the real pains involve onboarding builders and directing time and money to people and projects that could contribute to Evmos's short-term viability and long-term sustainability.\n\nBelow, we've drafted the text of a potential proposal to set up a grants initiative. You'll find details about how we envision this working for Evmos, our own motivations and how we think we can deliver value to the community. Please consider this an early version of what a decentralized grants program could be, informed by countless similar initiatives across Cosmos and Ethereum. If the community finds it to be successful or promising, we can address next steps in a subsequent proposal.\n\nEvmos Grants Initiative\n\nFunding the future of Evmos\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to create and test a community-led mechanism for distributing grants to applicants building on Evmos, the Evmos Grants Initiative (EGI). This initiative is focused on accelerating ecosystem adoption and growth through the design and implementation of an efficient process for evaluating and financing an increasing number of grant applications.\n\nThe goal of the initiative will be to identify community needs, vet and evaluate projects and teams, distribute grants and support and follow-up with projects. We will strive to build this system with a high-level of transparency and accountability.\n\nMotivation\n\nEvmos is experiencing an increasing need for developers, contributors, and tools. Because Evmos is still a young chain, many of the tools that exist on other chains are not yet available on or do not currently support Evmos. Similarly, some existing tools may not be adapted to Evmos, while others still may not yet exist.\n\nAccelerating network development to address our collective needs would no doubt benefit all stakeholders.\n\nWhile many projects are supported by well-funded or profitable teams, many new projects, individual initiatives or novel approaches may require small amounts of funding to be brought to life. Moreover, a wide variety of projects, aka “public goods”, often have little to no financing or rely heavily on donations. Some of these (education initiatives, documentation work, DAO tooling etc.) are essential to a healthy and viable ecosystem.\n\nAs founders of a DAO tooling project ourselves, we confront many of these challenges. Our personal motivations to kickstart and run this initiative are rooted in our own technical, operational and administrative experiences.\n\nContext\n\nAs of November 20th 2022, The Evmos community pool consisted of 111.49M Evmos tokens. Moreover, under the current token model, 10% of new tokens issued per epoch will be redirected to the Community Pool. At the current Evmos price of about $0.60, the community treasury is worth more than $66 million.\n\nThe Community Pool should be used to improve and build the Evmos ecosystem. Some great examples of this include the allocation of $75K Evmos to to support 5 IRL events (Prop 80); Launching Evmos liquidity incentives (Prop 64); and Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal (Prop 27)\n\nThus far, Community Pool spending has largely occurred through governance proposals. This process is extremely time consuming and requires huge coordination efforts from the community, which makes sense for large initiatives which require broad consensus.\n\nThe EGI will allow Evmos to spend the Community Pool funds more efficiently as the process would not be stiffened by bureaucracy. Through this initiative, a contributor can easily apply to receive $5K-$50K (in $EVMOS) of funding for the completion of value-added tasks which may be too small to be funded through a governance proposal.\n\nIt’s important to note that contributors will get paid in Evmos. By offering them skin in the game, successful contributors will gain from the upside their momentum creates, encouraging them to be long-term, active contributors to the ecosystem.\n\nApproach\n\nWhat makes a good grants program?\n\nWe have looked at existing programs across and beyond IBC in order to gather as much information about how existing programs work, how they are structured and how ecosystems define success.\n\nSome of these programs include the Osmosis’s OGP grants program, The Terra Developer fund (now the Grow Juno initiative), Solana Foundation Grants, Polygon Village Grants, the RetroPGF Experiment by Optimism, the Ethereum Foundation’s EF Ecosystem Support Program, as well as donation platforms such as Gitcoin and Giveth.\n\nWhile there are many approaches with varying levels of maturity and success, based on our findings, the easiest approach is to start simple. We propose 4 main objectives for the Evmos grants initiative: :\n\nSuccessfully identify the ecosystem’s needs\n\nFund useful projects based on the ecosystem’s needs\n\nCreate a high level of transparency\n\nScale with ecosystem growth\n\nWe hope to implement this model and iterate upon it until we achieve an efficient way to run grants in a decentralized and transparent way that aligns with the community’s expectations. In its first batch, we propose to start with a simple solution where much of the effort will be highly manual.\n\nIdentifying Needs\n\nThe approach we put forth for running a grants initiative is above all need-driven. We intend to engage with interested members of the community to accurately identify common and acute needs in order to most effectively source and fund solutions.\n\nAs a basis for the development of this grants initiative, we have put forth a model/funnel that will inform how we build the funding process and, in time, measure the success of the initiative.\n\nAll potential solutions : include the entire universe of projects, dapps and talent on which we can rely.\n\nSolutions we’re aware of : include the talent and projects inside and outside Evmos that we can identify as a community.\n\nApplicants : The solutions and teams that we have sourced or that have applied for a grant.\n\nFunded : The solutions and teams that have been approved to be funded.\n\nSucceeded : The solutions and teams that have been successfully completed and delivered.\n\nDelivered value : The subjective and objective value delivered to the ecosystem.\n\nAt the outset, we will dedicate the most time to formalizing steps 2 to 5, while paying active attention to step 6 in preparation for defining and measuring outcomes.\n\nSourcing Solutions\n\nSome work has already been done to identify potential projects that the community is interested in funding. Notably LPX has provided an excellent starting point for this research here:\n\nhttps://github.com/soulcialites/democracy-labs\n\nhttps://github.com/cryptotwilight/designproposal\n\nhttps://github.com/AllanM007/daoPOP\n\nhttps://github.com/billzhengC/ETHGlobal-Project-Aegis\n\nhttps://github.com/StableUnit/inclusive-dao-dapp\n\nhttps://d3guj2x59uz7wi.cloudfront.net/DAOPad\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/DAOkeeper/repositories\n\nhttps://connect.mushroom.social/\n\nhttps://github.com/smart-chain-fr/FairnessDAO\n\nhttps://github.com/gylim/proof-of-loyalty\n\nhttps://app.opencord.xyz/\n\nhttps://github.com/zenbitETH/eneagon\n\nhttps://bountygranter.surge.sh/\n\nhttps://github.com/pinalikefruit/UmbrellaDAO\n\nhttps://github.com/TalentLayer\n\nhttps://github.com/mercledao\n\nhttps://github.com/zguesmi/ethbogota22\n\nhttps://github.com/Trustless-ink/hackathon\n\nhttps://github.com/Mbappe21/EthBogota\n\nhttps://github.com/Alextnetto/private-governance\n\nhttps://github.com/Granted3-0/Grantd\n\nhttps://github.com/FloorGangETHNYC\n\nhttps://github.com/pumpedlunch/ETHNYC-performanceFlow\n\nhttps://ethereumsocialcontract.org/\n\nIn addition to leveraging the work that has already been done by @LPX , @Tricky | Cosmos Spaces and others, and in order to ensure the pertinence and quality of the grants initiative, we propose a two-pronged approach of both fielding inbound applications and outbound prospection in order to solicit projects to apply for grants.\n\nThere are 5 main initiatives we will deploy in order to accomplish this effort:\n\nConsolidate a list of grants beneficiaries from other grants programs both inside and outside of IBC;\n\nRun a series of workshops with community stakeholders (builders, validators, users, the foundation, etc.) each funding batch to source needs;\n\nHold office hours for community members that would like to discuss their precise needs;\n\nDevelop an application process ;\n\nAssemble requests for proposals with technical or operational specifications if necessary.\n\nWe will leverage our efforts to make any information that emerges from these efforts readily available to the community including the updated list of projects seeking grants across IBC and Ethereum as well as the consolidated results of the workshops. RFPs will also be published through the same channels.\n\nApplication and Selection Process\n\nSpontaneous Applications\n\nThe application process for spontaneous applications will be made up of 3 steps.\n\nThe first consists of a form through which a project team can enter specific details about the project, its goals, how it can contribute to the ecosystem and its funding needs. Applications will initially be reviewed by the EGI team for their relevance relative to the community’s expressed needs and seek advice from competent members in case of ambiguity.\n\nIf an application is deemed eligible for receiving a grant, the grants initiative team will interview the project team to evaluate their ability to execute and their approach to integrating with Evmos.\n\nThe grants initiative team may consult with competent members of the community when deliberating the decision to fund. Ultimately, the grants initiative team will publish the decision with a summary of the evaluation.\n\nRFPs\n\nRequests-for-proposals will be assembled in collaboration with community members that have expressed a similar need or interest.\n\nA basic summary of the RFP will be posted to the grants initiative Discord channel to serve as a reference for interested teams and projects.\n\nThe grants initiative will reach out to potential parties that could potentially respond to the RFP.\n\nOnce a shortlist is assembled, a member of the grants initiative team will lead the effort to draft a more complete RFP to submit to the interested solution providers.\n\nSome ideas for drafting the RFP collaboratively include conducting a workshop and organizing discussions with individual teams or members that may have a stake in the solution. When enough information has been assembled, the grants team will draft the RFP, submit it for review to community members who participated in its creation. After the RFP is published, the grants initiative will begin sourcing potential partners and complete steps 2 and 3 of the spontaneous application process.\n\nGrants Decisions and Follow-up\n\nThe entire grants application and selection process will be transparent to all members as all evaluations and decisions (positive and negative) will be published on the dedicated grants Discord channel.\n\nGrants decisions will include the name of the project, a description of the problem being solved, the details of the solution, the expected date of delivery and deployment, the funding amount, a list of the team members involved, the project details (e.g. DeWork, Treasury, etc.) and the status of the project.\n\nA member of the grants team ( @potrok or @Sheran ) will manage the relationship with the project team in order to stay informed about the progress and report back to the community.\n\nAs the number of applications grows, we will explore ways of decentralizing the evaluation mechanism by incentivizing reviews, review audits and funding decisions.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nBy decentralizing the grants function in a transparent way, Evmos can ensure that the ecosystem is able to access talent and build tools quickly to serve the immediate needs of the community.\n\nWe hope that by streamlining the funding process, Evmos will be able to accelerate technical, operational and financial development of the ecosystem.\n\nIt’s important to note that while we have been studying grants programs across various blockchains communities , there is no right answer. This initiative is meant to test the viability of a grants program that resembles and draws on existing efforts.\n\nIf the EGI is successful, we can choose how to scale it. If it is not, we can decide to rethink it or kill it entirely.\n\nNext Steps\n\nOur objective is to launch the first batch of grants by February 28, 2023. In order to achieve this deadline, we propose 2 months (December to February depending on if/when the proposal passes) of our time to set up the infrastructure and processes. By then, we aim to have:\n\nA dedicated channel for the EGI on the main Evmos Discord.\n\nInitial list of grants from other chains\n\nBuild and run 2 need discovery workshops for the community\n\nPublish a handful of initial RFP topics\n\nClearer references of experts and specialists within and outside of Evmos\n\nIdeally, and time permitting, we aim to run batch 1 between March 1, 2023 and April 30, 2023. These 2 months will be dedicated to sourcing and identifying projects that respond to community needs and marketing the grants program to relevant teams and projects on IBC and Ethereum.\n\nOur goal is to drive application volume and RFP interest.\n\nWe expect to have awarded batch 1 grants between April 30, 2023 and May 31, 2023.\n\nBetween April 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, we will aim to set up the second batch of the EGI. We will also follow up with projects that received grants and report back to the community during this time. Additionally, we will submit a new proposal for funding a second batch during the month of May. The community can choose to continue the program as is, make changes that can be applied to the second batch or halt it entirely.\n\nBudget\n\nRetroactive for first 2 months: $30K in Evmos for January and February\n\nOperational Budget: $15K in Evmos per month until June 30, 2023 (i.e. $60K total)\n\nMarketing and Communications Budget: $15k€\n\nGrants Budget: $250K per batch\n\nThe $250K per batch budget will be initially controlled by a ⅗ multisig composed of @potrok and @Sheran of the EGI team as well as 3 community members (e.g. @Tricky | Cosmos Spaces , @LPX , etc.). The budget will enable us to invest in promising projects and ensure their viability thanks to sufficient financing. What’s more, this budget ensures the program has enough funds to continue operating in case the price of Evmos goes down. In comparison to other L1 ecosystems, the budget and expenses proposed are fairly modest and can be revised as the initiative expands over the following months if the community deems this necessary.\n\nFrom an operational perspective, we expect to spend about 75% of our time to run the grants initiative. As part of our effort to justify our expenses, we’ve looked at other grants programs across various other IBC chains in order to evaluate the costs. We found that this can vary significantly. One of the most open discussions however has been taking place on Osmosis. Given the recent renewal of the OGP grants program ( Osmosis prop 362 ) our budget is more reasonable.\n\nWe will use the marketing and communications budget for outreach across the EVM ecosystem in order to communicate opportunities to build on Evmos to developers on other chains. We intend to work notably with Gnosis Chain, an ecosystem familiar to us where much DAO tooling is already being built.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho is on the team?\n\nWe are a small team of 7 people building DAO tooling on EVM-compatible chains and Solana. We’ve launched a reputation protocol, Lighthouse , on these chains that offers a more intuitive and comprehensive experience than systems like SourceCred or Coordinape.\n\nWe’ve been involved in IBC and Cosmos since 2017, but have never taken an active role in this ecosystem. With the arrival of Evmos, we see huge potential in this chain specifically and hope to contribute to its success.\n\n@potrok and @Sheran are cofounders of Lighthouse. Patrick is a UX designer, workshop designer and facilitator and three-time founder who ran a business process automation agency before creating Lighthouse with Sheran. Sheran is a self-taught developer and the former group CTO of a publicly traded company who left his job to work on DAO tooling.\n\nWe are accompanied in this initiative by 2 main advisors. Sébastien Couture of Interop Ventures and the Epicenter podcast works with us to navigate IBC. William Mougayar, chairman of the Kin Foundation and former Ethereum Foundation board member advises us on DAO tooling and ecosystem-wide needs for L1s.\n\nWhat’s the motivation?\n\nWe were first exposed to public goods at EthNY in May 2022. At the hackathon there we built an EVM app called Stargaze (no relationship with the IBC chain) that distributes donations to downstream contributors of public goods based on their amount of contribution. We won some prizes from Optimisim and Superfluid. Since then, we’ve been kind of obsessed with the topic. As web2 founders in a previous life, we didn’t have to confront the same challenges. Entrepreneurs and builders that came before us had already laid the groundwork.\n\nIn crypto, and specifically on Evmos, no one’s yet laid the rails. Our goal is to make sure that the foundations of Evmos are solid, especially when at this early stage much can still evolve.","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-30T11:49:30.776Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1zyyg0fd60uwc6u277lcnk5s3d2s0m54f6d706z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"potrok\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Co-founder at Lighthouse and The Orb\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-30T10:47:34.987Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"I'm starting this thread to discuss a potential proposal to set up and test a grants initiative geared at addressing 2 main challenges: 1) identifying the needs of the ecosystem and 2) sourcing, onboarding and funding projects to address these needs. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"/evmos/account/evmos1wysd8jm57wnrycnd3tqqyzx5wmwx72gwmtd924\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"@Sheran\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" and I had previously started a discussion about a project called \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7332-the-orb-evmos-public-goods-funding\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"the Orb\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\". In exchanging with more members of the community, we understood that while this funding mechanism is novel and promising, the real pains involve onboarding builders and directing time and money to people and projects that could contribute to Evmos's short-term viability and long-term sustainability.\\\\n\\\\nBelow, we've drafted the text of a potential proposal to set up a grants initiative. You'll find details about how we envision this working for Evmos, our own motivations and how we think we can deliver value to the community. Please consider this an early version of what a decentralized grants program could be, informed by countless similar initiatives across Cosmos and Ethereum. If the community finds it to be successful or promising, we can address next steps in a subsequent proposal.\\\\n\\\\nEvmos Grants Initiative\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Funding the future of Evmos\\\\n\\\\nAbstract\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"This proposal seeks to create and test a community-led mechanism for distributing grants to applicants building on Evmos, the Evmos Grants Initiative (EGI). This initiative is focused on accelerating ecosystem adoption and growth through the design and implementation of an efficient process for evaluating and financing an increasing number of grant applications.\\\\n \\\\nThe goal of the initiative will be to identify community needs, vet and evaluate projects and teams, distribute grants and support and follow-up with projects. We will strive to build this system with a high-level of transparency and accountability.\\\\n\\\\nMotivation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Evmos is experiencing an increasing need for developers, contributors, and tools. Because Evmos is still a young chain, many of the tools that exist on other chains are not yet available on or do not currently support Evmos. Similarly, some existing tools may not be adapted to Evmos, while others still may not yet exist.\\\\n\\\\nAccelerating network development to address our collective needs would no doubt benefit all stakeholders.\\\\n \\\\nWhile many projects are supported by well-funded or profitable teams, many new projects, individual initiatives or novel approaches may require small amounts of funding to be brought to life. Moreover, a wide variety of projects, aka “public goods”, often have little to no financing or rely heavily on donations. Some of these (education initiatives, documentation work, DAO tooling etc.) are essential to a healthy and viable ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nAs founders of a DAO tooling project ourselves, we confront many of these challenges. Our personal motivations to kickstart and run this initiative are rooted in our own technical, operational and administrative experiences. \\\\n\\\\nContext\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"As of November 20th 2022, The Evmos community pool consisted of 111.49M Evmos tokens. Moreover, under the current token model, 10% of new tokens issued per epoch will be redirected to the Community Pool. At the current Evmos price of about $0.60, the community treasury is worth more than $66 million. \\\\n\\\\nThe Community Pool should be used to improve and build the Evmos ecosystem. Some great examples of this include the allocation of $75K Evmos to to support 5 IRL events (Prop 80); Launching Evmos liquidity incentives (Prop 64); and Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal (Prop 27)\\\\nThus far, Community Pool spending has largely occurred through governance proposals. This process is extremely time consuming and requires huge coordination efforts from the community, which makes sense for large initiatives which require broad consensus. \\\\n\\\\nThe EGI will allow Evmos to spend the Community Pool funds more efficiently as the process would not be stiffened by bureaucracy. Through this initiative, a contributor can easily apply to receive $5K-$50K (in $EVMOS) of funding for the completion of value-added tasks which may be too small to be funded through a governance proposal. \\\\n\\\\nIt’s important to note that contributors will get paid in Evmos. By offering them skin in the game, successful contributors will gain from the upside their momentum creates, encouraging them to be long-term, active contributors to the ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nApproach\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"What makes a good grants program?\\\\n\\\\nWe have looked at existing programs across and beyond IBC in order to gather as much information about how existing programs work, how they are structured and how ecosystems define success. \\\\n\\\\nSome of these programs include the Osmosis’s OGP grants program, The Terra Developer fund (now the Grow Juno initiative), Solana Foundation Grants, Polygon Village Grants, the RetroPGF Experiment by Optimism, the Ethereum Foundation’s EF Ecosystem Support Program, as well as donation platforms such as Gitcoin and Giveth.\\\\n\\\\nWhile there are many approaches with varying levels of maturity and success, based on our findings, the easiest approach is to start simple. We propose 4 main objectives for the Evmos grants initiative: :\\\\n\\\\nSuccessfully identify the ecosystem’s needs\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Fund useful projects based on the ecosystem’s needs\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Create a high level of transparency\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Scale with ecosystem growth\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe hope to implement this model and iterate upon it until we achieve an efficient way to run grants in a decentralized and transparent way that aligns with the community’s expectations.

When enough information has been assembled, the grants team will draft the RFP, submit it for review to community members who participated in its creation. After the RFP is published, the grants initiative will begin sourcing potential partners and complete steps 2 and 3 of the spontaneous application process.\\\\n\\\\nGrants Decisions and Follow-up\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The entire grants application and selection process will be transparent to all members as all evaluations and decisions (positive and negative) will be published on the dedicated grants Discord channel.\\\\n\\\\nGrants decisions will include the name of the project, a description of the problem being solved, the details of the solution, the expected date of delivery and deployment, the funding amount, a list of the team members involved, the project details (e.g. DeWork, Treasury, etc.) and the status of the project.\\\\n\\\\nA member of the grants team (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"/evmos/account/evmos1zyyg0fd60uwc6u277lcnk5s3d2s0m54f6d706z\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"@potrok\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" or \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"/evmos/account/evmos1wysd8jm57wnrycnd3tqqyzx5wmwx72gwmtd924\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"@Sheran\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\") will manage the relationship with the project team in order to stay informed about the progress and report back to the community.\\\\n\\\\nAs the number of applications grows, we will explore ways of decentralizing the evaluation mechanism by incentivizing reviews, review audits and funding decisions.\\\\n\\\\nClosing thoughts\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"By decentralizing the grants function in a transparent way, Evmos can ensure that the ecosystem is able to access talent and build tools quickly to serve the immediate needs of the community.\\\\n\\\\nWe hope that by streamlining the funding process, Evmos will be able to accelerate technical, operational and financial development of the ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s important to note that while we have been studying grants programs across various blockchains communities , there is no right answer.

We will also follow up with projects that received grants and report back to the community during this time.

The budget will enable us to invest in promising projects and ensure their viability thanks to sufficient financing. What’s more, this budget ensures the program has enough funds to continue operating in case the price of Evmos goes down. In comparison to other L1 ecosystems, the budget and expenses proposed are fairly modest and can be revised as the initiative expands over the following months if the community deems this necessary.\\\\n\\\\nFrom an operational perspective, we expect to spend about 75% of our time to run the grants initiative. As part of our effort to justify our expenses, we’ve looked at other grants programs across various other IBC chains in order to evaluate the costs. We found that this can vary significantly. One of the most open discussions however has been taking place on Osmosis. Given the recent renewal of the OGP grants program (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/7603-updated-osmosis-grants-program-ogp-renewal\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Osmosis prop 362\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\") our budget is more reasonable.\\\\n\\\\nWe will use the marketing and communications budget for outreach across the EVM ecosystem in order to communicate opportunities to build on Evmos to developers on other chains.

The language for the process of Governance is one of the main parameters and we consider that the best language for Evmos Governance is the English language.\nSince the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by word meaning choice, by the punctuation signs, and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the unique arbiter for each, including the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).\n\n### Rules\n1. The accepted English dictionary for words and concepts and their semantic linking shall be the latest version of The Princeton Wordnet. http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/ with language option English (eng).\n2.

Imposter Krill from Krillbucks here.\n\nThe reason for writing this post is that I wish to convey constructive criticism in a non-offensive way.\n\nToday, we saw massive amounts of foundation delegations to select validators. First and foremost, congratulations to the chosen validators.\n\nIn this post, I will talk about two major concerns:\n\n1) The lack of a formal procedure and protocol on how foundation delegations are executed\n\n2) The size of foundation delegations that are being handed out\n\n1) The lack of a formal procedure and protocol on how foundation delegations are executed\n\nAs it was mentioned in Discord, \"delegations are undergoing an exploratory period and things will be rebalanced.\" However, without sounding too crass, delegations wouldn't have to go through an exploratory period or need rebalancing if there was a formal procedure and protocol for Foundation delegations.\n\nSome factors the community might want to consider other than the brief criteria listed on discord are:\n\nSize of foundation delegation based on each criteria point or in general\n\nDuration/Expiration of foundation delegation based on each criteria point or in general\n\nIf applicable, an agreement between the select validator and foundation on some level of agreed responsibility and good faith on handling foundation delegated tokens\n\nThe ambiguity of no submission form, with contributions being made known to the Foundation through the community is alarming. This can be seen and will be seen as arbitrary decision making based on haphazardness that could be boiled down to the mood of the people in charge of handling those delegations.\n\nSuggestion: A clear framework is necessary to protect everyone in the Evmos Ecosystem; understanding how and why things are the way they are benefits all actors involved.\n\nThere should be at least a simple and concise framework like Bitsong's delegation program ( https://github.com/bitsongofficial/delegation-program ) in place for everyone to understand how foundation delegations should be handled.\n\n2) The size of foundation delegations that are being handed out\n\nToday we saw delegations of 600k+ Evmos tokens distributed to a handful of select validators. 600k Evmos at this time is approximately worth 1.8 million dollars. We're talking about amounts that can shape who gets to be on the validator set and who doesn't, and at the very worst can be seen as kingmaking.\n\nI want to clarify, I am aware that the program had the intention of making delegations. Myself and the community weren't made aware of the scope of these delegations.\n\nI want to make it clear, I am not accusing any entity or persons of manipulating the validator set or kingmaking.

is looking forward to collaborating with the Evmos community and would like to propose registering $CMDX and $CMST as ERC-20 tokens on Evmos. When a proposal is initiated for an existing native Cosmos Coin, the ERC20 module will deploy a factory ERC20 contract representing the ERC20 token for the token pair. This enables access to DeFi protocols, NFT, and new applications that are based on ERC-20 (like AAVE, Diffusion, etc.)\n\nBackground\n\nComdex is building a DeFi infrastructure layer for the Cosmos ecosystem. A layer-1 infrastructure system for seamless deployment of DeFi applications in the Cosmos ecosystem, powering DeFi in the multi-chain future.\n\nThe core set of dApps on the chain will help form the foundation layer of money markets for Cosmos, namely:\n\nHarbor protocol: Interchain Stablecoin Issuance Protocol for $CMST (overcollateralized stablecoin)\n\ncSwap DEX: Hybrid Orderbook-style AMM DEX\n\nCommodo: Interchain liquidity protocol for lending-borrowing\n\nThese dApps form the foundational blocks of composable DeFi \"Legos,\" which will ultimately help users have democratized access to interchain money markets to ultimately integrate off-chain CeFi assets into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Harbor Protocol and cSwap are now live on the mainnet, and we're looking forward to potential partnership opportunities and exploring synergies between the Evmos and Comdex ecosystems.\n\nCMST would serve as a native decentralized stablecoin for the Evmos ecosystem.

As it stands now, 23.3% of the voting power in EVMOS is controlled by VC validators who participated in the latest EVMOS Foundation funding round.

For instance: everyone who would have had an EVMOS airdrop claim, will receive their decayed funds retroactively, without further activity needed from the user side? This could be achieved by an automatic process running at a given date, e.g. end of 2022, or by a permanent link on the dashboard. To keep things simple, entering an address (cosmos or evmos) and hitting \\\\\\\"claim\\\\\\\" should be enough. So no need to maintain a complicated rektdrop dashboard over the long term.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, the unclaimed funds will be returned to the community wallet, but for what purpose? Pissing off users who missed the deadline, are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"much \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"less likely to use the project in the future. This will cause more loss of value to the token, than the returned funds will be worth.\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-09-29T21:39:34.467Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T16:20:00.400Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-10-04T16:20:00.400Z","Address":{"id":60772,"address":"evmos1x8lrmjhtncl2r7xjt978wv5vpluvyg06yfm2u2","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-09-29T20:57:52.398Z","keytype":null,"name":null,"last_active":"2022-09-29T21:39:34.476Z","user_id":58518,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":55800,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":58518},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":952,"name":"1.

too old to be spending energy on publicly shaming everyone for shit like this, but I felt the need to defend the \"Governance Council\" after lurking for months and being amused at all the shit that unfolds in Cosmos. I'm old enough to be your dad and I've been in blockchain long enough to have been very involved in infamous The DAO (Genesis). Always had interest in Ethermint, so I've been lurking/following since launch with  fascination, amusement, frustration, and now concern.\n\nI had a great time chuckling and watching all you knuckleheads wrestle over governance for the past few months, but after [seeing this comedic piece](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8545-preproposal-restructure-dao-introducing-councils) by \"Phil\", I knew it was time to step in as the road he suggests is a dangerous road. Young blood, your intentions are good, probably. But you and that fuckin' weird Evmos volunteer group (btw, they creep me the fuck out - convinced they're some sick Russian AIs) need to stop trying to force your agenda of this perfect fuckin organization that you are trying to create. It's not possible. Follow the footsteps and learn from DAOs that have already succeeded. Now is not the time to daydream your little fantasies and experiment with completely ridiculous governance structures and hope it works. Not only is that outright dangerous for the network in terms of security, but goddamn, I think people are expecting initiatives ASAP, not in three years.\n\nThe ECP props show careful research and consideration that went into them. I know because when we first started we had absolutely no references to use to our advantage. From what I see, the strategic goals are achievable, relatively easily believe it or not. Much of the base contracts are forkable right now, for fucks sake, and its important to note that the initiatives proposed are obviously a mix of inspirations from the successes of existing DAOs that took the much riskier but needed route of ideation, experimentation, and creation of everything from scratch. We've made a lot of mistakes along the way so that you don't have to make the same ones. Don't recreate the wheel.\n\n**To the community: **\n\nLet the gov folks do their fuckin' jobs. It only benefits you. Their insecurities lead them to title themselves as high and mighty COUNCIL MEMBERS... _**\"ohhhhhm, so powerful, they must be, like, really important or something\"**_  ...who the fuck cares what their self-assigned titles are? They've made it clear that they are intending to put the treasury under the control of a governance smart contract. What are they going to do, hit us with some _suuuper_ scary proposals? This heightened level of paranoia... must be a Cosmos thing.\n\nAnd all this talk about how these guys \"self-appointed themselves in a massive power grab conspiracy to control the network\" needs to be put to rest. The way I see it, they worked for you for 6 months. Nothing ever came out that seemed bad intentioned. Every week, without fail, the \"council\" meetings with the core team has shown legitimate concerns and have shown their genuine care for growing the network. Adonis referred to them as Council, it was clear that they led the Evmos Governance, and not a single person objected or questioned. That's not self-appointment fellas. That's recognition. \n\nAll good right? _**COUNCIL, YALL KEEP WORKING HARD, YALL DOING GREAT!**_  **ZERO** talk of centralization, **ZERO** mentions of self-appointment, **ZERO** problems. Then they ask for funding because humans, teams, projects, initiatives - guess what - they all need funding like the real world _**GASPPPP**_ who would've known!? \n\nNow all of a sudden their work is atrocious, they're greedy, they're trying to take over the network, <insert whatever conspiracy bullshit yall think of next>, because they ask for funding that mostly was to ultimately going **BACK INTO** the community ANYWAYS. _How can we trust them with the treasury?! They can't be trusted! _\n\nFellas, you gave them FULL CONTROL of several multisigs funded by communitypool with no questions asked, and if my calculations are right, those wallets were worth $8-10 million at the time... seriously, go look at all the incentive props that passed. If their intentions were to run off with money and power they couldve done so, cause you dumbnuts failed to check that proper multisigs configurations were set. But anyways, we trust them to control that much when its for **other** projects, but when its for projects meant for **us** to grow and improve **our** token economics, suddenly _**THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED**_ \n\nWheres the logic in that? Fuck outta here with that bullshit. \n\n_But their pays are too high! They have vesting contracts! More Evmos going to these evil monsters!_\n\nHave none of you worked at a decent company before? Do y'all work minimum wage jobs (nothin' wrong with that young bloods, I did too most of my teens and early 20s, but it would explain a lot on why your panties are all tied up over the numbers). The base salaries are LAUGHABLE for the work they are doing. Whether you like it or not, through the past 6 months they have solidified themselves as the founding \"CEO, CFO, COO, C-Level exec-type\" roles within the DAO. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. And its good to see that they are uncomfortable with the status quo and are working to decentralize the DAO. \n\n Their responsibilities from what I can tell are a fuckton and range from: \n\n- giving the DAO vision and a sense of direction (aka LEADERSHIP) that the community can rally behind\n- setting up subdaos, payment structures, training cosmos DAO virgins, etc. (aka MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, HR)\n- identifying the huge holes in the way incentives are being given out and designing complex programs that are more beneficial to the community and network (aka FINANCIAL/TOKEN ECONOMICS ENGINEERING)\n- doubling down on progressive decentralization with a proposal in the works that would decentralize the network's flow of pool money i.e. incentives and grants through a dao platform/dashboard with a gauge and stake system (pretty sure that's what they are aiming for, AFAIK. That's PROTOCOL ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT)\n- helping projects and teams through governance and even with helping EDIT AND WRITE proposals (?!), while moderating the community social channels (jesus, thats EDITOR, ADVISOR, AND FUCKIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT LOL 🤣)\n\nLet that sink in, ya cucks. _**They essentially are the DAO**_ and there's NO ONE to blame but yourselves. **YOU let that happen**. No one stepped up to help them AFAIK, no one actively tried to start community initiatives to help, and as much as you hate to admit it, Evmos governance wouldn't exist as we know it today without them. There probably be no community-led incentive programs leaving us with a network-wide TVL of practically zero, proposal creation would have no formalized process, and the DAO would solely exist as a front for the Evmos Foundation. \n\nI'd say my observational skills have improved quite drastically over the years, with involvement in all kinds of DAOs, working with bullshitters, trying to keep up with go-getters, and dealing with people who mean well, but ultimately are a huge pain in the ass for governance. It's obvious to me why LPX was in such as rush to get the subDAO framework out. _**They're fuckin overloaded with work,**_ but they have huge ambitions they want for the network. \n\n\nMy quick observations into the initial three council members... (all assumptions and mini-detective work, dont fuckin quote me on this)\n\nLPX is a go-getter type. Sometimes too ambitious for their own good, but ultimately brings huge value to a DAO. LPX is obviously \"leading\" the DAO with a \"CEO and CTO\" type role. That's also the vibe I get from Adonis during gov meetings I've attended, as well as his CW posts.  He leads the governance workstream but hates to admit it. You can bet your ass I looked into his history as well, he may be pseudo-anon, but huge amounts of paper trail get left behind in the pseudo-anon world. I will respect his privacy, as I fuckin'  expect everyone to respect mine, so I wont go into much details. To the best of my judgement, from my limited research, I feel fairly confident as his proposals and ideas are coming from actual experience and mentorship with great organizations and leaders. He is also fairly well connected to many Ethereum DAOs and protocols.\n\nBenny seems to have stepped into a CFO and Communications type role. Seems very competent in traditional finances, accounting, and forecasting. I'd say he's responsible for all the numbers behind incentive proposals, but not too certain about his level of DeFi experience. Benny was comparatively much more difficult to find a trail, but if I had to take a guess, he's definitely working in the trad-fi sector. He is also more vocal than lpx when it comes to criticism. LPX either has a superiority complex that makes him not give a fuck about answering stupid ass questions and comments (eventually everyone in governance work will begin to develop this, stay sharp), or hes legitimately so overwhelmed or distracted with other work. While Benny is more vocal, but he doesnt seem comfortable or confident. Either way, I feel much better knowing that there is a finance savvy member member to assist the others. \n\nThese two are most likely taking paycuts compared to what they could be making elsewhere. Anyone who says otherwise is either delusional, still in high school, live in an underdeveloped nation, is incapable of English comprehension on a higher level, or live on a farm.\n\nYes, yes, I know, I read it many times, Cosmos DAOs dont pay their contributors as well as real DAOs. Well thats a fuckin shame in my view, and its no wonder all the DAO talent are hanging out in Ethereum.\n\nAnd yes, I know I didnt analyze GV.... to be honest I don't know what the fuck he does besides post a bunch of props.  I would like to learn more about what GV does and perhaps be givin more responsibilities if he is to take the same pay as benny. But then again, if the Council was more fuckin transparent we wouldnt be here right now with me so dumbfounded with with everything that I have to baby feed y'all kids on the proposal intent from the views of a veteran, the context around it, and the uncomfortable truth. (TBF: full transparency  is also a nearly impossible goal like full decentralization and autonomy)\n\nWhile on the topic of compensation, those against vesting also have never worked for a company of any value in an important role. It's there to motivate leaders to deliver with raised expectations and accountability, and to dissuade key members and talent from leaving in the middle of a project. In my book, if any contributor is still sittin contributing to Evmos more than 4 years without being voted off or losing interest in the Evmos Ecosystem, then fuck, they deserve to be crowned as  EVMOS GODS. Is it wrong for DAO contributors to be rewarded for dedication and (presumed) success? \n\nEnough is enough, while I initially enjoyed watching it unfold, y'all need to stop with this bullshit and focus on the real issues at hand. The ECP props may not be perfect, but at least they have solid plans and strategies that are being placed and developed.

I'm old enough to be your dad and I've been in blockchain long enough to have been very involved in infamous The DAO (Genesis). Always had interest in Ethermint, so I've been lurking/following since launch with  fascination, amusement, frustration, and now concern.\\n\\nI had a great time chuckling and watching all you knuckleheads wrestle over governance for the past few months, but after [seeing this comedic piece](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8545-preproposal-restructure-dao-introducing-councils) by \\\"Phil\\\", I knew it was time to step in as the road he suggests is a dangerous road. Young blood, your intentions are good, probably. But you and that fuckin' weird Evmos volunteer group (btw, they creep me the fuck out - convinced they're some sick Russian AIs) need to stop trying to force your agenda of this perfect fuckin organization that you are trying to create. It's not possible. Follow the footsteps and learn from DAOs that have already succeeded. Now is not the time to daydream your little fantasies and experiment with completely ridiculous governance structures and hope it works. Not only is that outright dangerous for the network in terms of security, but goddamn, I think people are expecting initiatives ASAP, not in three years.\\n\\nThe ECP props show careful research and consideration that went into them. I know because when we first started we had absolutely no references to use to our advantage. From what I see, the strategic goals are achievable, relatively easily believe it or not. Much of the base contracts are forkable right now, for fucks sake, and its important to note that the initiatives proposed are obviously a mix of inspirations from the successes of existing DAOs that took the much riskier but needed route of ideation, experimentation, and creation of everything from scratch. We've made a lot of mistakes along the way so that you don't have to make the same ones. Don't recreate the wheel.\\n\\n**To the community: **\\n\\nLet the gov folks do their fuckin' jobs. It only benefits you. Their insecurities lead them to title themselves as high and mighty COUNCIL MEMBERS... _**\\\"ohhhhhm, so powerful, they must be, like, really important or something\\\"**_  ...who the fuck cares what their self-assigned titles are? They've made it clear that they are intending to put the treasury under the control of a governance smart contract. What are they going to do, hit us with some _suuuper_ scary proposals? This heightened level of paranoia... must be a Cosmos thing.\\n\\nAnd all this talk about how these guys \\\"self-appointed themselves in a massive power grab conspiracy to control the network\\\" needs to be put to rest. The way I see it, they worked for you for 6 months. Nothing ever came out that seemed bad intentioned. Every week, without fail, the \\\"council\\\" meetings with the core team has shown legitimate concerns and have shown their genuine care for growing the network. Adonis referred to them as Council, it was clear that they led the Evmos Governance, and not a single person objected or questioned. That's not self-appointment fellas. That's recognition. \\n\\nAll good right? _**COUNCIL, YALL KEEP WORKING HARD, YALL DOING GREAT!**_  **ZERO** talk of centralization, **ZERO** mentions of self-appointment, **ZERO** problems. Then they ask for funding because humans, teams, projects, initiatives - guess what - they all need funding like the real world _**GASPPPP**_ who would've known!? \\n\\nNow all of a sudden their work is atrocious, they're greedy, they're trying to take over the network, <insert whatever conspiracy bullshit yall think of next>, because they ask for funding that mostly was to ultimately going **BACK INTO** the community ANYWAYS. _How can we trust them with the treasury?! They can't be trusted! _\\n\\nFellas, you gave them FULL CONTROL of several multisigs funded by communitypool with no questions asked, and if my calculations are right, those wallets were worth $8-10 million at the time... seriously, go look at all the incentive props that passed. If their intentions were to run off with money and power they couldve done so, cause you dumbnuts failed to check that proper multisigs configurations were set. But anyways, we trust them to control that much when its for **other** projects, but when its for projects meant for **us** to grow and improve **our** token economics, suddenly _**THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED**_ \\n\\nWheres the logic in that? Fuck outta here with that bullshit. \\n\\n_But their pays are too high! They have vesting contracts! More Evmos going to these evil monsters!_\\n\\nHave none of you worked at a decent company before? Do y'all work minimum wage jobs (nothin' wrong with that young bloods, I did too most of my teens and early 20s, but it would explain a lot on why your panties are all tied up over the numbers). The base salaries are LAUGHABLE for the work they are doing. Whether you like it or not, through the past 6 months they have solidified themselves as the founding \\\"CEO, CFO, COO, C-Level exec-type\\\" roles within the DAO. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. And its good to see that they are uncomfortable with the status quo and are working to decentralize the DAO. \\n\\n Their responsibilities from what I can tell are a fuckton and range from: \\n\\n- giving the DAO vision and a sense of direction (aka LEADERSHIP) that the community can rally behind\\n- setting up subdaos, payment structures, training cosmos DAO virgins, etc. (aka MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, HR)\\n- identifying the huge holes in the way incentives are being given out and designing complex programs that are more beneficial to the community and network (aka FINANCIAL/TOKEN ECONOMICS ENGINEERING)\\n- doubling down on progressive decentralization with a proposal in the works that would decentralize the network's flow of pool money i.e. incentives and grants through a dao platform/dashboard with a gauge and stake system (pretty sure that's what they are aiming for, AFAIK. That's PROTOCOL ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT)\\n- helping projects and teams through governance and even with helping EDIT AND WRITE proposals (?!), while moderating the community social channels (jesus, thats EDITOR, ADVISOR, AND FUCKIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT LOL 🤣)\\n\\nLet that sink in, ya cucks. _**They essentially are the DAO**_ and there's NO ONE to blame but yourselves. **YOU let that happen**. No one stepped up to help them AFAIK, no one actively tried to start community initiatives to help, and as much as you hate to admit it, Evmos governance wouldn't exist as we know it today without them. There probably be no community-led incentive programs leaving us with a network-wide TVL of practically zero, proposal creation would have no formalized process, and the DAO would solely exist as a front for the Evmos Foundation. \\n\\nI'd say my observational skills have improved quite drastically over the years, with involvement in all kinds of DAOs, working with bullshitters, trying to keep up with go-getters, and dealing with people who mean well, but ultimately are a huge pain in the ass for governance. It's obvious to me why LPX was in such as rush to get the subDAO framework out. _**They're fuckin overloaded with work,**_ but they have huge ambitions they want for the network. \\n\\n\\nMy quick observations into the initial three council members... (all assumptions and mini-detective work, dont fuckin quote me on this)\\n\\nLPX is a go-getter type. Sometimes too ambitious for their own good, but ultimately brings huge value to a DAO. LPX is obviously \\\"leading\\\" the DAO with a \\\"CEO and CTO\\\" type role. That's also the vibe I get from Adonis during gov meetings I've attended, as well as his CW posts.  He leads the governance workstream but hates to admit it. You can bet your ass I looked into his history as well, he may be pseudo-anon, but huge amounts of paper trail get left behind in the pseudo-anon world. I will respect his privacy, as I fuckin'  expect everyone to respect mine, so I wont go into much details. To the best of my judgement, from my limited research, I feel fairly confident as his proposals and ideas are coming from actual experience and mentorship with great organizations and leaders. He is also fairly well connected to many Ethereum DAOs and protocols.\\n\\nBenny seems to have stepped into a CFO and Communications type role. Seems very competent in traditional finances, accounting, and forecasting. I'd say he's responsible for all the numbers behind incentive proposals, but not too certain about his level of DeFi experience. Benny was comparatively much more difficult to find a trail, but if I had to take a guess, he's definitely working in the trad-fi sector. He is also more vocal than lpx when it comes to criticism. LPX either has a superiority complex that makes him not give a fuck about answering stupid ass questions and comments (eventually everyone in governance work will begin to develop this, stay sharp), or hes legitimately so overwhelmed or distracted with other work. While Benny is more vocal, but he doesnt seem comfortable or confident. Either way, I feel much better knowing that there is a finance savvy member member to assist the others. \\n\\nThese two are most likely taking paycuts compared to what they could be making elsewhere. Anyone who says otherwise is either delusional, still in high school, live in an underdeveloped nation, is incapable of English comprehension on a higher level, or live on a farm.\\n\\nYes, yes, I know, I read it many times, Cosmos DAOs dont pay their contributors as well as real DAOs. Well thats a fuckin shame in my view, and its no wonder all the DAO talent are hanging out in Ethereum.\\n\\nAnd yes, I know I didnt analyze GV.... to be honest I don't know what the fuck he does besides post a bunch of props.  I would like to learn more about what GV does and perhaps be givin more responsibilities if he is to take the same pay as benny. But then again, if the Council was more fuckin transparent we wouldnt be here right now with me so dumbfounded with with everything that I have to baby feed y'all kids on the proposal intent from the views of a veteran, the context around it, and the uncomfortable truth. (TBF: full transparency  is also a nearly impossible goal like full decentralization and autonomy)\\n\\nWhile on the topic of compensation, those against vesting also have never worked for a company of any value in an important role. It's there to motivate leaders to deliver with raised expectations and accountability, and to dissuade key members and talent from leaving in the middle of a project. In my book, if any contributor is still sittin contributing to Evmos more than 4 years without being voted off or losing interest in the Evmos Ecosystem, then fuck, they deserve to be crowned as  EVMOS GODS. Is it wrong for DAO contributors to be rewarded for dedication and (presumed) success? \\n\\nEnough is enough, while I initially enjoyed watching it unfold, y'all need to stop with this bullshit and focus on the real issues at hand. The ECP props may not be perfect, but at least they have solid plans and strategies that are being placed and developed. The other proposal is just an abstract, untested idea with no feasible way for execution. I am warning you, learn from the mistakes we made when we just began to experiment with smart contracts. LPX is correct in his previous posts, there is a very legitimate and valid reason why DAOs take the route of progressive decentralization.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Authors:** \n\n- LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend. With a participation rate of almost 90%, the Governance Workstream will most likely be fighting to maintain the status quo, as we are almost at the ceiling.\n\n| Rank | Network  | Voter Turnout | Sample Data (20 Props) | Data |\n| ---- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |-------------|\n| 1    | Evmos    | 87.35%        | Proposals 44 - 64                 | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1701165887)  |\n| 2    | Juno     | 82.88%        | Proposals 14 - 39                   | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=248293121)  |\n| 3    | Osmosis  | 64.74%        | Proposals 319 - 340                | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1919390603)   |\n| 4    | Stargaze | 61.85%        | Proposals 30 - 53                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=508354030) |\n| 5    | Cosmos   | 47.49%        | Proposals 56 - 77                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=206262929) |\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7I6nd2O.png)\n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nIn addition to all the proposals that have gone on-chain, the Evmos Community has seen a tremendous, sustained growth in off-chain governance participation, specifically on Commonwealth.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/413Pd2P.png)\n\n---\n\n### Workstream Members and Organizational Structure\n\n**Workstream Structure**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of \n - This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the stewards rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy.\n - Workstream leaders in their second term are automatically elected to a Governance Council Director role.\n - In practice, it is expected that Council Contributors and Council Directors operate and communicate as equals.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 267,614 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 500,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 700,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,792,614 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles.

ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\n\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \n\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \n\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\n\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \n - Community-governed incentives program\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\n\n\n## Motivation \n\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \n\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\n\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \n\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\n\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \n\n\n---\n\n\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\n\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \n\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\n\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\n\n\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\n\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\n\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \n\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \n\n---\n\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\n\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \n\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\n\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \n\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\n\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \n\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\n\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \n\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\n\n\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\n\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community. We hope that our previous efforts are recognized by the Community and is a testament to our genuine dedication to the advancement of the Evmos ecosystem and network. \n\nThe target operational, development, and incentives runway with this funding request is **one year**; however, we hope to extend that runway as much as possible through various programs. On the other hand, the absolute best case scenario for the DAO would be to achieve self-sustainability by late next year. \n\n| # | Initiative | Description | Allocation  | \n| - | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Workstream (SubDAO) Funding | Compensation of current and future workstream members and the funding of workstream initiatives. | 20%     |\n| 2 | GOV Tokenomics & Community Gauges | The $GOV token and the gauge system is designed to decentralize Liquidity Incentives allocation, promote long-term alignments, and facilitate off-chain governance voting. | 12.5%     |\n| 3 | Boosted Liquidity Vaults & veGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that are community-led, more transparent, DEX-agnostic, and shared benefits. | 22.5%     |\n| 4 | Perpetual Bounty Fund & deGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that is community-led, more transparent, and is DEX-agnostic. | 10%     | \n| 5 | Treasury Growth & yGOV | Initial funding for DeFi revenue generation strategies and yield-bearing GOV tokens | 7.5%     |\n| 6 | Treasury Bonds | Building community-owned liquidity through the sales of treasury issued bonds. | 5%     |\n| 7 | Strategic Reserves | The reserves will be used only when strategic opportunities are presented to the DAO or rebalancing of the treasury is necessary.

A combination of tried and true strategies as well as novel implementations in DeFi and smart contracting will be utilized. Heavy inspiration is drawn from well-established and successful DAOs that have pioneered the way in governance philosophies and decentralized finance and economics: MakerDAO, Compound, Curve, Yearn, Gnosis, 1Hive, Uniswap, Sushi, Aave, ShapeShift, Balancer, MolochDAO, and many more.\n\n### GOV: Evmos DAO Governance Base Token Layer\n\nAlignment between the Evmos DAO governance token (GOVMOS, or GOV for short) holders and protocol stakeholders (EVMOS) is crucial for an *efficient* decentralized governance -- GOV tokens are the vehicle to drive this alignment. GOV tokens are not a financial investment, although there will be economic benefits. GOV token holders are typically DAO contributors and Evmos Community members who are committed to seeing the continued growth of the Evmos ecosystem, and want a seat at the governance table.\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work — reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and voting on every matter can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain.\n\nThis approach is not to be a gatekeeper of decisions - anyone who wishes will be able to participate. The key difference between on-chain proposals and off-chain DAO proposals is that DAO governance is *voluntary*. \n\n$GOV will be launched as an ERC20 with a 1:1 EVMOS backing. In simpler terms, depositing one EVMOS token will mint you one GOV token; reciprocally, returning one GOV token will release one EVMOS token. GOV tokens are transferrable, fungible, and tradeable. GOV serves as the base layer token for the many functions of its derivatives. **Holding GOV tokens do not grant any voting power.**\n\n**Important concept to remember:** `$GOVMOS` is essentially `$WEVMOS` but with expanded feature sets that allow the DAO and community participants to create and govern the following derivatives and programs. \n\n### GOV Derivatives Overview\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WN7f8LC.png)\n\n\n### veGOV: Aligned & Incentivized Decentralized Decision Making\n\nParticipating in Evmos DAO governance requires that a wallet have a balance of vote-escrowed GOV (veGOV). veGOV is a non-standard ERC20 implementation, popularized and battle-tested by DAOs on Ethereum, that determines each wallet's voting power.\n\nveGOV is obtained by depositing and locking GOV into the DAO's escrow contract. The maximum lock time is two years, and the minimum one month. \n\nThe amount of veGOV received is proportional to the lock-time selected - locking 100 GOV for the maximum two year period will return 100 veGOV. A one year lock of 100 GOV would return 50 veGOV, and so forth. \n\nOnce veGOV is issued to a wallet the tokens will automatically begin decaying at a 1/2 slope linear rate until the time-lock period is reached. For example, if 500 veGOV tokens were rewarded at the time of deposit, 250 veGOV would remain at the time when the vesting period is complete and the original GOV tokens are available for withdrawal. \n\nUsers may decide to keep the original GOV tokens vested even after the completion date in order to retain the remaining veGOV. However, as soon as the original GOV tokens are claimed back into the originating wallet, the remaining veGOV will burn itself.\n\nThe vote-escrowed approach plays several crucial roles in the DAO's governance and our long term goals:\n\n1) Significantly reduces Sybil and other attack vectors in off-chain governance proposals\n2) Ensures that participants are aligned with the long-term goals of the DAO and our vision\n3) Incentivizes governance participation with boosted yields\n4) Will be the main driver of the Liquidity Incentives Program 2.0 with community-governed incentives allocation and DEX-agnostic TVL growth\n5) Generates recurring revenue and treasury diversification through DAO-owned liquidity\n\n**Liquidity Gauges**: A pre-determined amount of EVMOS tokens will be allocated towards Liquidity Incentives each month. veGOV weight from community participants will ultimately dictate the allocation of incentives for each liquidity pool. \n\nThrough the gauge system we are able to run our liquidity incentives program perpetually and in a much more decentralized, fair, and community-centric method. \n\n**Multi-Token Liquidity Mining**: Each pool's Gauge contract can distribute up to 5 different kinds of tokens. This allows for multiple partners/protocols/DAOs to incentivize a given pool by adding their own tokens. \n\nThe goal of the Liquidity Guages is to be as permissionless and community-governed as possible. However, the Governance Council may blacklist tokens from being able to be deposited as an incentivization token to combat spam.\n\n**Liquidity Vaults (Lockers)**: DAO-owned liquidity vaults (farms) will be deployed to maintain our stance of neutrality and allow the natural growth and healthy competition between DEXs and DeFi protocols. \n\nIn an effort to facilitate the steady growth of Evmos' TVL and liquidity, incentives will be boosted for those who commit to a bonding period when depositing their LP tokens. Auto-compounding contracts will also be deployed and utilized to maximize the yield for depositors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KcoDXpG.png)\n\n**Current Problem**: While Prop 64 provided the Evmos network the much needed native liquidity, the proposal was not designed to be a long-term solution. The TVL that has been built is held hostage by the high farming APRs provided at the expense of the Community Pool. The lack of any lockup mechanism also encourages \"pool hopping\" leading to potentially volatile liquidity and subsequently volatile price movements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4ScBYt4.png)\n\n \n### deGOV: Governance Rewards for Network Decentralization Assistance\n\nDelegated GOV tokens, or deGOV are similar to veGOV in that they hold voting weight. However, while veGOV is deflationary once received, deGOV gains voting weight the longer they are staked with the DAO. deGOV tokens are minted at a 1:2 ratio, meaning a 10 GOV deposit will return 5 deGOV.\n\ndeGOV does not have a maximum time-lock period, but will stop accruing voting power at 24 months, with a voting weight boost of 2x of the original deposit. The minimum bonding time is one month,\n\n**The Perpetual Bounty Fund**\n\ndeGOV will play a key role in the maintaining the sustainability of the Community Perpetual Bounty Fund. The concept of the Perpetual Bounty Fund straightforward - the DAO participates in network staking for the purpose of creating a self-replenishing fund for bounties, contributor payments, and special initiatives. \n\n- The authz module is utilized to re-stake “maintenance” token amounts to offset the daily changing APR.\n- A portion of the daily rewards (TBD) are sent to a claiming contract in which deGOV holders may wish to claim their share of the staking rewards.\n- The remainder of the rewards are claimed and sent back into a DAO treasury wallet used for bounties and funding initiatives. \n- If the bounty fund's growth is far exceeding the pace of outbound funds, the DAO may choose to re-route the funds to another program or into the Strategic Reserve fund.\n\nBounties can range from internal growth initiatives to external outreach campaigns. An internal growth example would be to bounty out a SourceCred deployment on Evmos to incentivize participation in governance, encourage constructive discussions, nurture a culture of helping others, etc. The potential bounties and programs can also act as an assistance tool for the core devs by contributing in areas like the improvement and expansion of the Evmos documentation. \n\nAs we eagerly wait for our community to grow and have leaders step up in the creation of new workstreams, bounties are an excellent tool to not only lighten the already heavy workload, but to attract talent, long-term contributors, and future leaders.\n\n**Delegation Gauges**: Similar to Liquidity Gauges, the community will have the power to decide the allocation amounts for 75% of the delegateable tokens from the Perpetual Bounty Fund. The Governance Council, although unlikely to happen often, reserves the right to decide the monthly delegation amounts of the remaining 25%.\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is restricted from delegating to any validator in the top 25 by VP, calculated at the last day of each month. Any votes towards the top 25 validators will be disregarded and allocations distributed proportionately to the eligible validators.  \n\n### yGOV: Yield Bearing Single-Sided Staking Rebase Tokens\n\nYield bearing GOV (or yGOV) are obtained by depositing GOV into an escrow contract controlled by the DAO. **yGOV does not have any voting weight.**\n\nyGOV is a rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with GOV. EVMOS tokens that are represented by the deposited GOV will be deployed into the network's DeFi ecosystem to generate optimized yields. The rebasing occurs shortly after every Evmos epoch and the yields are transferred directly to the users. This allows the constant accural of yields without the need for any action from the end user. \n\nThe redemption (unbonding) time for yGOV is 15 days. Instant withdrawals may be possible depending on the reserve liquidity available at that the time, but will incur a harsh 25% penalty fee. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R48AOko.png)\n\n\n**Liquidity Reserve**: A small reserve liquidity for the yGOV<>GOV swap contract will be maintained for those who are in an emergency and willing to incur the penalty fee.\n\n**yvGOV (Yield-Bearing Vested GOV)** is another GOV deriviative that is being researched. yvGOV will be a vested version of yGOV, with similar characteristics of veGOV. \n\n## Treasury Bonds Market\n\nProtocol owned liquidity (POL) is an important topic that is constantly brought up as one of the most important aspects of growing a healthy treasury. While POL is mostly used in the context of DeFi protocols' and product/service DAOs' treasuries, Evmos DAO is unique in that we are serving a community of an entire Layer-1 Blockchain. Thus, we feel justified in using the term \"Community Owned Liquidity.\" Just as we defend the integrity of the Evmos Constitution and our Governance System, we must fight to defend the value of our network. \n\n**Benefits of Community Owned Liquidity**\n\n- Diversification of Assets\n- Revenue Generation from Swap Fees\n- Long-term Aligned Ecosystem Growth\n- Stable Network-Wide Liquidity\n\n[WIP]\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:32:35.427Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\\n\\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \\n\\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\\n\\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \\n - Community-governed incentives program\\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\\n\\n\\n## Motivation \\n\\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \\n\\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\\n\\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \\n\\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\\n\\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \\n\\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\\n\\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\\n\\n\\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\\n\\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\\n\\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \\n\\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\\n\\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \\n\\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\\n\\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \\n\\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\\n\\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \\n\\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\\n\\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \\n\\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\\n\\n\\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\\n\\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community.

ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\n\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\n\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \n\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \n\n---\n\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\n\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\n\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\n\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\n\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \n\n\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\n\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\n\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\n\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\n\n## 4. Workstream Stages\n\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\n\n - Informal\n - Proposed\n - Active\n - Inactive\n\n\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\n\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n\n**Compensation Principles**\n\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\n\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO. Talented and dedicated members should want to remain working with the DAO.\n\n**Compensation Types**\n\n1) **Retroactive Compensation**: compensation and rewards for previous contributions made to the DAO. There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \n\n**Compensation Eligibility**\n\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. \n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment\n- The monthly compensation amount\n- Compensation rationale (base and vested)\n\n## Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment | Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. | Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training. | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role. | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill. Contributor should have experience in the domain and will be expected to excel in assigned duties. | Difficult to replace, domain-expertise in addition to deep organizational-specific knowledge required (i.e. knowledge in the DAO's governance processes, financial and revenue structures, ongoing projects, etc.) |\n| Contribution Importance | The level of importance of the duties held by a contributor for the long-term success of the DAO as well as the Evmos network. | Little to no effect on the Evmos ecosystem. Such roles are likely to be in experimental workstreams or external-facing projects. | Important to the long-term growth of the Evmos ecosystem. | Crucial importance - contributions will have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and the Evmos ecosystem. |\n| Value Level | Calculated by simply taking the average of the three aforementioned assessments. | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n\n2. **Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios:\n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking.\n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle:\n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Self | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties. |\n| 1.5 | Workstream / subDAO | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream. |\n| 2 | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3. |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO.\n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n**Exhibit D: MVP Vesting Contract Dashboard for Admins and Contributors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmCC9oy.png)\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:19:11.205Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\\n\\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \\n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \\n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \\n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\\n\\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \\n\\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\\n\\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\\n\\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\\n\\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\\n\\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\\n\\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \\n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \\n\\n\\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\\n\\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\\n\\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\\n\\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\\n\\n## 4. Workstream Stages\\n\\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\\n\\n - Informal\\n - Proposed\\n - Active\\n - Inactive\\n\\n\\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\\n\\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\\n\\n**Compensation Principles**\\n\\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\\n\\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO.

There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \\n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \\n\\n**Compensation Eligibility**\\n\\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO.

This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:19:11.210Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T00:26:54.839Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-02T14:28:44.187Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-29T14:20:04.863Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-12-17T11:17:56.898Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

This document is a condensed version of the ECP Framework; for the full-length version refer to the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provide a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.\n\nThe Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n\n**Motivation:** The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. The Governance Workstream and the Community have been self-regulating and informally enforcing the general guidelines posted in [“Best Practices”](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) — however, as we prepare to expand the scope and responsibilities of Evmos DAO, we must prepare for another influx of proposals by providing clear guidelines and proposal standardization. \n\nWe strongly believe that our governance participation is among the highest in the blockchain space because of our continued efforts in building a culture of open discussion, strong due diligence, helping one another, and our willingness to assist newcomers navigate the waters of governance. While I am confident that our Community will continue building great culture, a standardized proposal framework and clear lifecycle guideline will ensure that our governance continues on this path for the long-term.\n\n---\n\n# ECP Framework Components\n\n## 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\n\n### Proposal Types\n\n**On-Chain Governance**\n\nOn-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes and takes precedence over the delegated validators of the voter. \n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance**\n\nOff-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. \n\n### Proposal Types by Category\n\n - Protocol Proposals\n - Community Proposals\n - Meta-Governance Proposals\n - Workstreams & Special Initiatives\n - Community Grants & Funding\n - Protocol Incentives & Evmos Specific Proposals\n - Network Upgrades and Security\n\nRefer to the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/definitions) for more details.\n\n\n## 2. The ECP Lifecycle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D8IcfJS.png)\n\n**Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \\[IDEATION\\]**\n\nThe purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. \n\nAnyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.\n\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PRE-PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nPhase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an Evmos Community Proposal and includes all of the criteria specified in the ECP Framework. It must be a clear and complete description of the discussions and ideas held in the previous phase. \n\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nThe author may finalize the ECP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must add a poll within the thread to gauge the community sentiment.\n\nProposals should only move to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments, responded to all concerns and questions, and believes that the proposal is ready to go on-chain for a final network-wide vote. Proposals in Phase 3 should not be edited further with the exception of minor mistakes. \n\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: \\[VOTING\\]**\n\nIf the signaling polls in Phase 3 show an overall positive sentiment and no major issues are brought up, the proposal may be submitted on-chain for the formal voting. Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\n\n\n### Exceptions to the Framework\n\n**Governance Council**\n\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \"fast-track\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\n\n**Core Developers**\n\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\n\n\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\n\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \n\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\n\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\n\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\n\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:16:21.430Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\\n\\n\\n### Exceptions to the Framework\\n\\n**Governance Council**\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \\\"fast-track\\\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\\n\\n**Core Developers**\\n\\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\\n\\n\\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\\n\\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \\n\\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\\n\\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\\n\\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\\n\\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\\n\\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:16:21.436Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T01:00:35.190Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-03T08:20:49.073Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-29T14:20:04.863Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-12-17T11:17:56.898Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

ECP-0: Proposals to Advance Governance and Support the Growth of Evmos DAO and the Network Ecosystem\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** The following proposals are the culmination of thousands of hours of research and calculated deliberation. I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \n\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \n\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\n\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\n\n---\n\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \n\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \n\n---\n\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \n\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \\n\\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \\n\\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \\n\\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\\n\\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \\n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\\n\\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\\n\\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \\n\\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n\\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \\n\\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\\n\\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \\n\\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

Varadinov ( @vladfortech ), Evmos Core Teams\n\nParameters being changed with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 100% .\n\nThe current module parameters can be queried as follows:\n\n➜ evmosd q revenue params --node=https://tendermint.bd.evmos.org:26657 addr_derivation_cost_create: \"50\" developer_shares: \"0.500000000000000000\" enable_revenue: true\n\nMotivation\n\nThe x/revenue module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the Evmos Token Model  , this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The **************** developer_shares parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.\n\nConsidering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 100% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.\n\nWe acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.\n\nIf this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the commission on staking rewards and 100% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.\n\nImpact\n\nRegistered smart contracts will receive 100% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.\n\nBelow are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:\n\nAt current Evmos price ($0.40637**)** and *************minGasPrice (*************20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.00466466 * 200000 txs = $932.93\n\nAt Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.01669652 * 100000 txs = $1,669.65\n\nAt optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.03756717 * 50000 txs = $1,878.35\n\nGas price calculations were generated with this calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBefore voting, please read through this proposal and the current comments. We encourage any and all feedback from the community regarding this parameter change.","kind":"discussion","stage":"Proposal","url":null,"topic_id":1177,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-16T21:46:06.162Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1my3w8f69wxqajwj64lt07ws97u4em4rjcvvwr8\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"mmm\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-13T23:59:15.516Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Authors\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Vladislav Varadinov (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"%5B%3Chttps://twitter.com/vladfortech%3E%5D(%3Chttps://twitter.com/vladfortech%3E)\\\",\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"@vladfortech\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"), Evmos Core Teams\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nParameters being changed with this proposal\\\\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"developer_shares\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" parameter in the revenue module from \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"50% to 100%\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe current module parameters can be queried as follows:\\\\n➜ evmosd q revenue params --node=https://tendermint.bd.evmos.org:26657\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"addr_derivation_cost_create: \\\\\\\"50\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"developer_shares: \\\\\\\"0.500000000000000000\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"enable_revenue: true\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Motivation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"x/revenue\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers.

thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place. Community members have expressed concerns over this, and have proposed moving back the decay date to a later date and to reimburse the decayed tokens.\n\nPLAN OF ACTION\n\nWe delay the start of the Rektdrop decay to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022.\n\nSignal commitment to reimburse anyone who experienced decay on their airdrop before the newly set date of Monday August 1st, 2022 . These tokens will be reimbursed from the community pool at a later date after all the data is gathered and verified.\n\nWe fast track this proposal on chain if there are no concerns or red flags from the community to limit the amount of decay users experience and make step 2 simpler.\n\nThis will not only ensure users don't experience decay at no fault of their own, but also give more time for new users to claim this airdrop to promote healthy token distribution for Evmos.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe push back the Rektdropt decay date to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022 @ approximately 09:00 UTC. We signal agreement that any user who experienced decay before the newly set decay date should have those tokens reimbursed by the community pool at a later time after we gather the proper info and come up with the plan to send these funds back.\n\nConsidering the start of decay being less than the socially agreed 3 days for a commonwealth discussion, we may fast track this proposal on chain to limit the decay for users if there is no opposition from community members.\n\nI will update the thread with relevant information and decisions as the discussion matures and it is needed.

all,\n\nI want to start a discussion on enabling the inflation module on Evmos Mainnet.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted.\n\nAfter the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\nensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n\ngive more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling the inflation module would mean, that\n\nstaking rewards,\n\nusage incentives and\n\ncommunity pool allocation\n\nare enabled.\n\nTesting on Testnet\n\nWith proposal 28 the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\nstaking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n\ninteracting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts. The incentives pool fills up once a day through inflation\n\nquerying the community pool: a part of inflation is allocated in the community pool once a day. Query the community pool to make sure it's increasing according to the Evmos Token Model .\n\nNote, that the team allocation of the Evmos Token Model is not handled through inflation but instead was implemented with vesting accounts .\n\nDiscussion\n\nBefore voting on the Mainnet proposal please follow and discuss this proposal on this page.

post is somewhat related to and goes some way towards addressing the concerns brought up in this post.\n\nAssuming an average 6.5s block time on mainnet (evmos_9001-2), active validators can get away with only signing half of the blocks in a ~54 hour window without being slashed. In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\n\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\n\nSignedBlocksWindow : change from \"30000\" to \"10000\".\n\nMinSignedPerWindow : change from \"0.500000000000000000\" to \"0.050000000000000000\"\n\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.

In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\\\\n\\\\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"SignedBlocksWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"30000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"10000\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"MinSignedPerWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"0.500000000000000000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"0.050000000000000000\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.
