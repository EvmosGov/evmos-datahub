Summary\n\nNeokingdom DAO applies to register its ERC-20 NEOK token as an Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) token. The address of the ERC-20 token is [0x6d99370d239014bc53c72316f04c6f9c80fc91ef](https://escan.live/address/0x6d99370d239014bc53c72316f04c6f9c80fc91ef). The NEOK token is an updated and immutable version of our previous one ([NEOK V0](https://escan.live/address/0xA31c18929590B87eC11D854d1424b059f1D94732), total supply of ~160k), and it has a total supply of zero at the moment. At the moment we are finalizing our smart contracts that regulate minting and supply of the NEOK token. Once the contracts are finalized and audited, we will do a token migration from the old \"V0\" contract to the new NEOK contract. Our attempt to register the NEOK contract while finalizing the other contracts is to parallelize and be more efficient with our resources.\n\nOur objective is to integrate the NEOK token into the broader IBC ecosystem, opening up new opportunities for Neokingdom users and enhancing the functionality of the Neokingdom platform.\n\nRegistering the NEOK token as an IBC token will provide significant benefits to our users, our ecosystem, and the broader blockchain community. These benefits include:\n\n- Enhanced Liquidity: Integrating NEOK token with the IBC ecosystem will increase the token's liquidity, making it more accessible and valuable for our users.\n- Broader Adoption: Registering NEOK token as an IBC token will attract a wider user base, fostering greater adoption and promoting the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n## About Neokingdom DAO\n\nNeokingdom DAO is an innovative Estonian private limited company focused on developing a comprehensive ecosystem for DAOs. We provide a robust legal and technical framework that enables businesses to restructure their formation and operation into legally compliant DAOs. Neokingdom DAO was launched in 2022. At present, the first business has joined our ecosystem and restructured itself successfully into a DAO. We expect a few others to join shortly and then grow exponentially.\n\nIn 2022, Neokingdom DAO was awarded the [second prize in the web3 track](https://devpost.com/software/teledisko-dao).\n\nWithin our ecosystem, each participating business maintains a stake in Neokingdom DAO, while Neokingdom DAO reciprocally holds a stake in every associated DAO. The NEOK token embodies not only the ownership, voting, and dividend rights in Neokingdom DAO but also extends these rights to all DAOs that are part of our ecosystem.\nEach token in our ecosystem represents €1 of contributed value (see [Teledisko Token](https://escan.live/token/0x64fd2411c9b6c0d2f6f70daa77bac63e93d6ab2b) and [Neokingdom Token](https://escan.live/token/0xa31c18929590b87ec11d854d1424b059f1d94732Q)).\n\nAs we continue to enhance Neokingdom platform, we are in the process of finalizing a new version of our smart contracts, which will undergo a thorough audit before implementation.

The NEOK token is an updated and immutable version of our previous one ([NEOK V0](https://escan.live/address/0xA31c18929590B87eC11D854d1424b059f1D94732), total supply of ~160k), and it has a total supply of zero at the moment. At the moment we are finalizing our smart contracts that regulate minting and supply of the NEOK token. Once the contracts are finalized and audited, we will do a token migration from the old \\\"V0\\\" contract to the new NEOK contract. Our attempt to register the NEOK contract while finalizing the other contracts is to parallelize and be more efficient with our resources.\\n\\nOur objective is to integrate the NEOK token into the broader IBC ecosystem, opening up new opportunities for Neokingdom users and enhancing the functionality of the Neokingdom platform.\\n\\nRegistering the NEOK token as an IBC token will provide significant benefits to our users, our ecosystem, and the broader blockchain community. These benefits include:\\n\\n- Enhanced Liquidity: Integrating NEOK token with the IBC ecosystem will increase the token's liquidity, making it more accessible and valuable for our users.\\n- Broader Adoption: Registering NEOK token as an IBC token will attract a wider user base, fostering greater adoption and promoting the growth of our ecosystem.\\n\\n## About Neokingdom DAO\\n\\nNeokingdom DAO is an innovative Estonian private limited company focused on developing a comprehensive ecosystem for DAOs. We provide a robust legal and technical framework that enables businesses to restructure their formation and operation into legally compliant DAOs. Neokingdom DAO was launched in 2022. At present, the first business has joined our ecosystem and restructured itself successfully into a DAO. We expect a few others to join shortly and then grow exponentially.\\n\\nIn 2022, Neokingdom DAO was awarded the [second prize in the web3 track](https://devpost.com/software/teledisko-dao).\\n\\nWithin our ecosystem, each participating business maintains a stake in Neokingdom DAO, while Neokingdom DAO reciprocally holds a stake in every associated DAO. The NEOK token embodies not only the ownership, voting, and dividend rights in Neokingdom DAO but also extends these rights to all DAOs that are part of our ecosystem.\\nEach token in our ecosystem represents €1 of contributed value (see [Teledisko Token](https://escan.live/token/0x64fd2411c9b6c0d2f6f70daa77bac63e93d6ab2b) and [Neokingdom Token](https://escan.live/token/0xa31c18929590b87ec11d854d1424b059f1d94732Q)).\\n\\nAs we continue to enhance Neokingdom platform, we are in the process of finalizing a new version of our smart contracts, which will undergo a thorough audit before implementation. Once these new smart contracts are ready, we will migrate our tokens to the new NEOK contract.\\n\\nIn parallel with these efforts, we are moving forward with our plan to register the NEOK token as an IBC coin.\\n\\nOther links:\\n\\n- Website: https://neokingdom.org/\\n- GitHub: https://github.com/NeokingdomDAO\\n- Limited company info: https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16638166/Neokingdom-DAO-O%C3%9C\\n\\n\"}"],"links":null,"has_poll":null,"canvas_action":"{}","canvas_session":"{}","canvas_hash":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","created_at":"2023-04-13T21:44:52.425Z","updated_at":"2023-05-12T08:45:41.035Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-05-03T08:36:19.993Z","Address":{"id":58147,"address":"evmos1f66xakgc4v4qxuyxlyrn6p5w7055jmppj3f3zu","chain":"evmos","verified":"2023-05-03T08:35:56.503Z","keytype":null,"name":"Alberto 🏰 Neokingdom DAO","last_active":"2023-05-03T08:36:19.993Z","user_id":55992,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":53274,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":55992},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1161,"name":"4.

Total request increased from 738k to 800k Evmos\n\n===================================================================\n\n# ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream \n**Author**\n- [Evmos DAO](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO) - Governance Workstream\n- [tlopplot](https://t.me/tlopplot) - CMS Workstream\n\n**Summary**\nThe Community Moderation & Support Workstream that has been serving the Evmos Community is officially requesting formalization by funding.\n\n## 1. Workstream Introduction \nThe strength of a community is not only determined by the number of members, but also the quality of their interactions. The Evmos community represents the face of the network. As such, we believe it is pivotal to foster a supportive, respectful, engaging, and inclusive environment worthy of this representation. The Evmos Community Moderation and Support Workstream is a continuation of the work which began in late 2021 voluntarily. With over 30,000 Discord and 17,000 Telegram members, both platforms must be professionally maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nAs the Evmos CMS Workstream we act as a neutral party with allegiance only to the Evmos network. We offer a trusted source of support to network users, promote community growth by maintaining a welcoming environment, and provide helpful resources, news, and updates related to the Evmos network. \n\n**Mission**: Protect, educate, support, inform, and grow the Evmos community. As well as foster an engaging and inclusive environment.\n\n**Vision**: To see the Evmos Community platforms grow into an invaluable resource for the Evmos network and it's users.\n\n**Values**: Equality, Positivity, Continuos Education\n\n## 2. Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n### A. Respond to inquiries from Evmos community members\nThe Evmos CMS Workstream serves to help and support each member of the community. Our contribution stretches over all relevant social platforms like Discord, Reddit and Telegram. We manage user issues by providing solutions and options within reasonable time limits and follow up to ensure resolution. We encourage safe practices and keep scammers out of the communities by integration and maintaining state of the art bots. \n\n### B. Maintain direct lines with Evmos-Core\nThe CMS workstream acts as a close entity to the Evmos core team. They are our primary source for development progress. As such, we hold regular meetings to keep us updated with the latest ongoings. Additionally, we give feedback of user experiences (bug reports), test new features (conversions, tools, etc.) and help them out whenever it is necessary. \n\n### C. Prepare written materials and guidance on the use of the Evmos network\nModerators have been hard at work bolstering the knowledge-base resources available to members of the Evmos community. As new features launches, the CMS creates instructional guides aimed at educating users on how to interact with them. As Evmos is built on top of two different runtimes (Cosmos and EVM) the complexity is quite high. As such, written materials and guidance has besides supporting the community the highest value proposition.\n\n## 3. Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n### A. CMS Expansion \nOur objective is to expand the existing CMS Framework team during the first funding period to ensure seamless and efficient support services. To this end, we plan to hire and train 1 Junior Moderator, 2 Senior Moderators, and a CMS Workstream Leader. Which would bring the total size of the workstream to 11 members, comprised of 8 JR, 2 SR, 1 LEAD. We believe this staff size is the minimum required to accomodate 24 hour support coverage. This will enhance our support coverage on both Discord and Telegram platforms, enabling us to promptly address any queries or concerns raised by users of the protocol.\n\n### B. Social Awareness and Self Independence\nThe CMS workstream will act as an independent DAO entity. While being such an important figure within the Evmos network, it is crucial to actively create social awareness and broaden its outreach. Therefore, the CMS workstream will create and grow its own brand - similar to [OsmoSupportLab](https://twitter.com/OsmoSupportLab)\n\n### C. Community Incentives\nThere are people outside of Community Support that make the community vibrant. Through adding to discussions, creating guides, participating in governance, helping out where they see help is needed. And that sort of contribution ought to be recognized.\n\nThe Evmos Community Rewards Program (ECRP) is an CMS Workstream initiative aimed at fostering adoption and supporting the Evmos ecosystem. Up to 5000 Evmos are rewarded to those that stand out in merit and act in the interest of the Evmos ecosystem as a whole. Any Evmos not rewarded in a given period will be rolled over for future use in the program. These rewards will be publicly announced on our socials in a transparent and traceable manner. Only non-paid contributors will be taken into consideration. \n\n## 4. Progress Report and Achievements \nSince January 2022, Evmos CMS has resolved nearly 3,000 support tickets and assisted countless others through public and private chats on Discord, Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. We’ve been there to help support and guide the community through key issues such as the chain halts, the Nomad hack, airdrop and Ledger issues. Along with day-to-day problems solved and clarifications given. Evmos CMS needs an assortment of skill sets, most importantly a deep familiarity with both Cosmos and EVM tooling, this sets Evmos CMS apart from other support teams.\n\n### Stats \n- **Discord**: \n  - 32,000+ members\n  - Nearly 3,000 support tickets resolved & 23,000+ messages sent\n  - Full integration and management of bots: Dyno, Faucet, Double Counter, Carl and Support-Ticket\n  - Lean structure \n\n- **Telegram**:\n  - ~17,000 (11,000 active) users and ~300,000 messages were exchanged.\n  - Full integration of Evmos Chad. He takes over anti-spam, media-filter, community moderation, captcha and more. Requires constant amendments. \n    - Running [@EvmosAnnouncements](https://t.me/EvmosAnnouncements) with ~2,500 subscribers.\n\n- **Reddit**: \n  - Construction of the Evmos reddit site \n  - 70,147 unique readers (all time)\n  - 624,036 page views \n  - 3,400 moderation actions have been taken\n  - 2,871 subscribers \n\n## 5. Workstream Members and Organizational Structure \n### A. Moderator Types \nCommunity Moderators shall be composed of three (3) position types: \n\n**1. Jr Moderators:** These Moderators will be the backbone of Evmos support and community moderation. Handling various tasks from enforcing server rules to providing general support.\n**2. Sr Moderators:** These Moderators will have the same responsibilities of Jr moderators, but they will also take on a larger role with more accountability. Additional duties include training new Jr moderators, handling inquiries between various chains, projects and points of contact, handling server security and keeping track of KPIs.\n**3. CMS Workstream Leader:** This individual will have the same responsibilities of Sr Moderators, but will be accountable for the overall performance of the workstream. The CMS lead will also represent the workstream within the Evmos DAO Governance Council. Being part of the Evmos DAO multisig and handling transactions relating to pay. As well as being a primary contact between the Evmos Community Moderator and Support Workstream and the foundation. This role may also be responsible for delivering concise, quick and knowledgeable solutions in case of emergency. \n\n### B. Salary Starting 1st March 2023 + Retroactive Compensation\nGiven the current climate, pay has decreased across the Cosmos ecosystem for similar roles and positions. Evmos, a layer 1 network, presents unique challenges that require versatility unmatched by other Cosmos chains. Mods need to be knowledgeable in both IBC and EVM technology and infrastructure! With this in mind we propose the following pay schedule and conditions:\n\n**Conditions**\n- Hourly requirement per week: 24\n- Minimum Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystem experience: 3 months\n- Internal KPI metrics\n- Salary JR: 3,360 (USD)\n- Salary SR: 4,032 (USD)\n\n**Salary**\nThe compensation is based on the approved framework of [ECP-1 | Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83).\nThus, the salary is calculated as follows:\n- Jr: $28 * 1.25 * (160hr/mt * 0.6) = 3,360\n- Sr: $28 * 1.50 * (160hr/mt * 0.6) = 4,032\n\n| Name           | Position | PT/FT | BASE (USD)           | Retro (EVMOS) | Bonus (EVMOS) | Vesting Emission Rate(1y - EVMOS) | Note          |\n|:------------------------- | -------- | ----- |:------------------------------- |:-------------------- |:----- |:---------------------------------- |:----------------------- |\n| Rok            | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  8,374  | 7,560               |             |\n| Tlopplot         | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  5,899  | 7,560               |             |\n| Hotwind          | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  5,899  | 7,560               |             |\n| Dev_D           | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  5,899  | 7,560               |             |\n| Čozķinğ          | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  2,285  | 7,560               |             |\n| Ömer           | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | -          |  2,309  | 7,560               |             |\n| Cozmo           | Jr    | PT  | 3,360              | 85,438        |  8,374  | 7,560               | Unpaid since Jan 2022  |\n| Kori           | -    | -   | -                | -          |  4,447  | -                 | Contract ended 12/19/22 |\n| Zotish          | -    | -   | -                | -          |  6,512  | -                 | Contract ended 11/30/22 |\n| OPEN           | JR    | PT  | 3,360              |           |    | TBD            |             |\n| ~~OPEN~~           | ~~SR~~    | ~~PT~~  | ~~4,032~~              |           |    | ~~TBD Cycle 2~~            |             |\n| ~~OPEN~~           | ~~SR~~    | ~~PT~~  | ~~4,032~~              |           |    | ~~TBD Cycle 2~~            |             |\n| OPEN           | LEAD   | FT  | 6,720   (est)            |          |    | TBD Cycle 2            |             |\n|              |     |    |                 |           |    |                  |             |\n| ~~**Projected 6 Mo.

All other current and former moderators were compensated by Tharsis as contractors at a rate of 2500 USDC per month. This contract requires the individual to complete the KYC process with Tharsis, which Cozmo has opted against.\n\nWe respect Cozmo's decision to opt against completing the KYC process and recognize his important contribution to the community and dedication to working over a year unpaid. This proposal requests 85,438 EVMOS for retroactive payment at the contract rate equivalent to $2,500 per month during his tenure as a moderator.\n*RETRO FORMULA: <code>($2,500 * 13.67 (CONTRIBUTED_MONTHS thru Feb. 2023))/TOKEN_PRICE </code>\n\n**Bonus Compensation Rationale** \nThe CMS workstream often spent full-time week hours into supporting the Evmos community since its inception. Navigating significant events like the chain halt, nomad exploit and airdrop claim issues were especially challenging for moderators and the community alike. \n\nAs recognition for this pivotal contribution and support for the network, this proposal requests 50,000 EVMOS to be shared amongst current & past moderators based on their time contributed. This amounts to 613 EVMOS per month contributed, per person. \n\nBennylava, GV, & Kilo have opted against being included in this bonus pool.\n\n**Vesting Rationale**\nWe truly believe the long term growth of Evmos network should be aligned with long term incentives. As such, we propose a vesting account for each CMS member. The vesting logic is based on the [ECP-1C | Standardizing Contributor Compensations](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7630-ecp1cwip-standardizing-contributor-compensations) framework. The formula is <code>Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level</code>\n\nConditions: \n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as WEVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone’s Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent – thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO.\n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n\n### C. Accountability \nEach CMS member is measured and accountable for their performance. This will be tracked with internal KPI metrics, such as tickets attended to, moderation commands used, time spent in the server and so on. If an individual CM is struggling to fulfill their duties, CMS leadership will work with them to understand the root cause and provide the necessary support and training.\n\n## 6. Total Funding Request\nThis proposal requests funding for a 6 month period beginning March 2023. Retroactive compensation and Bonus compensation is a one-time event for the past hard and loyal work of the moderators during 2022. Any unused tokens at the end of the funding period will be rolled into the next period.\n\n\n| CATEGORY         | EVMOS    | Note              |\n|:------------------------- |:----------- |:------------------------------- |\n| SALARY BASE        | 453,600   | 7 JR, 1 LEAD, 1 JR BUFFER    |\n| RETRO           | 86,050   |                 |\n| BONUS           | 50,000   |                 |\n| VESTING (EVMOS) 1y    | 52,920   |                 |\n| CONTINGENCY FUND     | 100,800   | 20% of the Salary Base Category |\n| COMMUNITY INCENTIVES   | 5,000    | See section 3.C         |\n| TOOL COSTS (USD)     | 500     | Bots, GSuite, Notion, etc.   |\n| **Projected 6 Mo.

Workstream Introduction \\nThe strength of a community is not only determined by the number of members, but also the quality of their interactions. The Evmos community represents the face of the network. As such, we believe it is pivotal to foster a supportive, respectful, engaging, and inclusive environment worthy of this representation. The Evmos Community Moderation and Support Workstream is a continuation of the work which began in late 2021 voluntarily. With over 30,000 Discord and 17,000 Telegram members, both platforms must be professionally maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \\nAs the Evmos CMS Workstream we act as a neutral party with allegiance only to the Evmos network. We offer a trusted source of support to network users, promote community growth by maintaining a welcoming environment, and provide helpful resources, news, and updates related to the Evmos network. \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, educate, support, inform, and grow the Evmos community. As well as foster an engaging and inclusive environment.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see the Evmos Community platforms grow into an invaluable resource for the Evmos network and it's users.\\n\\n**Values**: Equality, Positivity, Continuos Education\\n\\n## 2. Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n### A. Respond to inquiries from Evmos community members\\nThe Evmos CMS Workstream serves to help and support each member of the community. Our contribution stretches over all relevant social platforms like Discord, Reddit and Telegram. We manage user issues by providing solutions and options within reasonable time limits and follow up to ensure resolution. We encourage safe practices and keep scammers out of the communities by integration and maintaining state of the art bots. \\n\\n### B. Maintain direct lines with Evmos-Core\\nThe CMS workstream acts as a close entity to the Evmos core team. They are our primary source for development progress. As such, we hold regular meetings to keep us updated with the latest ongoings. Additionally, we give feedback of user experiences (bug reports), test new features (conversions, tools, etc.) and help them out whenever it is necessary. \\n\\n### C. Prepare written materials and guidance on the use of the Evmos network\\nModerators have been hard at work bolstering the knowledge-base resources available to members of the Evmos community. As new features launches, the CMS creates instructional guides aimed at educating users on how to interact with them. As Evmos is built on top of two different runtimes (Cosmos and EVM) the complexity is quite high. As such, written materials and guidance has besides supporting the community the highest value proposition.\\n\\n## 3. Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n### A. CMS Expansion \\nOur objective is to expand the existing CMS Framework team during the first funding period to ensure seamless and efficient support services. To this end, we plan to hire and train 1 Junior Moderator, 2 Senior Moderators, and a CMS Workstream Leader. Which would bring the total size of the workstream to 11 members, comprised of 8 JR, 2 SR, 1 LEAD. We believe this staff size is the minimum required to accomodate 24 hour support coverage. This will enhance our support coverage on both Discord and Telegram platforms, enabling us to promptly address any queries or concerns raised by users of the protocol.\\n\\n### B. Social Awareness and Self Independence\\nThe CMS workstream will act as an independent DAO entity. While being such an important figure within the Evmos network, it is crucial to actively create social awareness and broaden its outreach. Therefore, the CMS workstream will create and grow its own brand - similar to [OsmoSupportLab](https://twitter.com/OsmoSupportLab)\\n\\n### C. Community Incentives\\nThere are people outside of Community Support that make the community vibrant. Through adding to discussions, creating guides, participating in governance, helping out where they see help is needed. And that sort of contribution ought to be recognized.\\n\\nThe Evmos Community Rewards Program (ECRP) is an CMS Workstream initiative aimed at fostering adoption and supporting the Evmos ecosystem. Up to 5000 Evmos are rewarded to those that stand out in merit and act in the interest of the Evmos ecosystem as a whole. Any Evmos not rewarded in a given period will be rolled over for future use in the program. These rewards will be publicly announced on our socials in a transparent and traceable manner. Only non-paid contributors will be taken into consideration. \\n\\n## 4. Progress Report and Achievements \\nSince January 2022, Evmos CMS has resolved nearly 3,000 support tickets and assisted countless others through public and private chats on Discord, Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. We’ve been there to help support and guide the community through key issues such as the chain halts, the Nomad hack, airdrop and Ledger issues. Along with day-to-day problems solved and clarifications given. Evmos CMS needs an assortment of skill sets, most importantly a deep familiarity with both Cosmos and EVM tooling, this sets Evmos CMS apart from other support teams.\\n\\n### Stats \\n- **Discord**: \\n  - 32,000+ members\\n  - Nearly 3,000 support tickets resolved & 23,000+ messages sent\\n  - Full integration and management of bots: Dyno, Faucet, Double Counter, Carl and Support-Ticket\\n  - Lean structure \\n\\n- **Telegram**:\\n  - ~17,000 (11,000 active) users and ~300,000 messages were exchanged.\\n  - Full integration of Evmos Chad. He takes over anti-spam, media-filter, community moderation, captcha and more. Requires constant amendments. \\n  - Running [@EvmosAnnouncements](https://t.me/EvmosAnnouncements) with ~2,500 subscribers.\\n\\n- **Reddit**: \\n  - Construction of the Evmos reddit site \\n  - 70,147 unique readers (all time)\\n  - 624,036 page views \\n  - 3,400 moderation actions have been taken\\n  - 2,871 subscribers \\n\\n## 5. Workstream Members and Organizational Structure \\n### A. Moderator Types \\nCommunity Moderators shall be composed of three (3) position types: \\n\\n**1. Jr Moderators:** These Moderators will be the backbone of Evmos support and community moderation. Handling various tasks from enforcing server rules to providing general support.\\n**2. Sr Moderators:** These Moderators will have the same responsibilities of Jr moderators, but they will also take on a larger role with more accountability. Additional duties include training new Jr moderators, handling inquiries between various chains, projects and points of contact, handling server security and keeping track of KPIs.\\n**3. CMS Workstream Leader:** This individual will have the same responsibilities of Sr Moderators, but will be accountable for the overall performance of the workstream. The CMS lead will also represent the workstream within the Evmos DAO Governance Council. Being part of the Evmos DAO multisig and handling transactions relating to pay. As well as being a primary contact between the Evmos Community Moderator and Support Workstream and the foundation. This role may also be responsible for delivering concise, quick and knowledgeable solutions in case of emergency. \\n\\n### B.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\n\n## Authors \n- LPX | Evmos DAO\n- GV | Evmos DAO \n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n\nThis proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)). An [FAQ page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/faq.md) has been created and will kept up to date with important questions asked by the Community.\n\n## Preface \n\nFollowing the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.\n\nAddressed issues from Proposal 86:\n\n1. The total token request has been significantly [reduced by 80% in this proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n2. R&D, Ecosystem Bootstrap, and Treasury Diversification funds have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.\n3. The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).\n4. Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### The Governance Workstream's Mandate\n\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\n- Duties, Responsibilities, Deliverables of the Governance Workstream: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/duties.md)\n\n### Contributions to Evmos\n\nThe Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars. \n\n- List of Achievements and Progress Report: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/report.md)\n\n### Progressive Decentralization \n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\n\nWhile we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThis 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~80% to the previous proposal and represents now 0.81% of the community pool. The dollar amount requested at current price was also reduced from $2.37mil to $380K. For a breakdown of the ask reduction, please [refer to this page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n\n**Contributor Compensations**\n\nThe funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.\n- A detailed outline of contributor compensation: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/contributors.md)\n\n**Total:** 950,000 EVMOS\n\n### Fund Disbursements\n\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury\" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 5 Validators in a `5-8` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending will be publicly viewable with full transparency. Spending, compensations, swaps, and all expense reports will be rigorously kept up to date. \n\n**Treasury Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Long | Notional\n- OutCast | Legion Nodes\n- Yubin Park | a41\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600) (evmos1c0z326g3haflz2gnk68q2vsfv5mtxpsqgqgd0v)\n\n*The total funding request of the proposal may be adjusted accordingly in the event of market volatility and major price swings. This clause serves as a safeguard for our planned 6-month runway and our treasury diversification plans, and is a notice to the Evmos community that the final ask amount may be different than what is being presented today.*\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":16,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-01-18T12:50:06.091Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos177ggk979ag3cjyt6vevzep2spl3xyfdtsq0937\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Evmos DAO\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/503fc65a-9177-474e-83f4-e159cefb3173.jpg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-01-18T11:42:33.766Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\" ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"## Authors \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n- LPX | Evmos DAO\\\\n- GV | Evmos DAO \\\\n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\\\\n\\\\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\")), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months.

ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\n\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\n\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \n\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \n\n---\n\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\n\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\n\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\n\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\n\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \n\n\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\n\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\n\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\n\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\n\n## 4. Workstream Stages\n\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\n\n - Informal\n - Proposed\n - Active\n - Inactive\n\n\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\n\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n\n**Compensation Principles**\n\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\n\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO. Talented and dedicated members should want to remain working with the DAO.\n\n**Compensation Types**\n\n1) **Retroactive Compensation**: compensation and rewards for previous contributions made to the DAO. There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \n\n**Compensation Eligibility**\n\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. \n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment\n- The monthly compensation amount\n- Compensation rationale (base and vested)\n\n## Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment | Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. | Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training. | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role. | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill. Contributor should have experience in the domain and will be expected to excel in assigned duties. | Difficult to replace, domain-expertise in addition to deep organizational-specific knowledge required (i.e. knowledge in the DAO's governance processes, financial and revenue structures, ongoing projects, etc.) |\n| Contribution Importance | The level of importance of the duties held by a contributor for the long-term success of the DAO as well as the Evmos network. | Little to no effect on the Evmos ecosystem. Such roles are likely to be in experimental workstreams or external-facing projects. | Important to the long-term growth of the Evmos ecosystem. | Crucial importance - contributions will have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and the Evmos ecosystem. |\n| Value Level | Calculated by simply taking the average of the three aforementioned assessments. | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n\n2. **Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios:\n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking.\n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle:\n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Self | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties. |\n| 1.5 | Workstream / subDAO | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream. |\n| 2 | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3. |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO.\n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n**Exhibit D: MVP Vesting Contract Dashboard for Admins and Contributors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmCC9oy.png)\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":10,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:19:11.205Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\\n\\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \\n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \\n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \\n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\\n\\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \\n\\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\\n\\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\\n\\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\\n\\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\\n\\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\\n\\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \\n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \\n\\n\\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\\n\\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\\n\\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\\n\\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\\n\\n## 4. Workstream Stages\\n\\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\\n\\n - Informal\\n - Proposed\\n - Active\\n - Inactive\\n\\n\\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\\n\\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\\n\\n**Compensation Principles**\\n\\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\\n\\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO.

There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \\n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \\n\\n**Compensation Eligibility**\\n\\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO.

This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.\\n\"}"],"links":[{"title":"[ECP-1C][WIP] Standardizing Contributor Compensations","source":"thread","identifier":"7630"}],"has_poll":true,"canvas_action":null,"canvas_session":null,"canvas_hash":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:19:11.210Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T02:57:27.628Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-02T14:28:44.187Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2023-05-08T09:16:21.351Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2023-05-14T07:27:22.977Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"keplr-ethereum","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

This document is a condensed version of the ECP Framework; for the full-length version refer to the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provide a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.\n\nThe Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n\n**Motivation:** The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. The Governance Workstream and the Community have been self-regulating and informally enforcing the general guidelines posted in [“Best Practices”](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) — however, as we prepare to expand the scope and responsibilities of Evmos DAO, we must prepare for another influx of proposals by providing clear guidelines and proposal standardization. \n\nWe strongly believe that our governance participation is among the highest in the blockchain space because of our continued efforts in building a culture of open discussion, strong due diligence, helping one another, and our willingness to assist newcomers navigate the waters of governance. While I am confident that our Community will continue building great culture, a standardized proposal framework and clear lifecycle guideline will ensure that our governance continues on this path for the long-term.\n\n---\n\n# ECP Framework Components\n\n## 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\n\n### Proposal Types\n\n**On-Chain Governance**\n\nOn-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes and takes precedence over the delegated validators of the voter. \n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance**\n\nOff-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. \n\n### Proposal Types by Category\n\n - Protocol Proposals\n - Community Proposals\n - Meta-Governance Proposals\n - Workstreams & Special Initiatives\n - Community Grants & Funding\n - Protocol Incentives & Evmos Specific Proposals\n - Network Upgrades and Security\n\nRefer to the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/definitions) for more details.\n\n\n## 2. The ECP Lifecycle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D8IcfJS.png)\n\n**Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \\[IDEATION\\]**\n\nThe purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. \n\nAnyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.\n\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PRE-PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nPhase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an Evmos Community Proposal and includes all of the criteria specified in the ECP Framework. It must be a clear and complete description of the discussions and ideas held in the previous phase. \n\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nThe author may finalize the ECP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must add a poll within the thread to gauge the community sentiment.\n\nProposals should only move to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments, responded to all concerns and questions, and believes that the proposal is ready to go on-chain for a final network-wide vote. Proposals in Phase 3 should not be edited further with the exception of minor mistakes. \n\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: \\[VOTING\\]**\n\nIf the signaling polls in Phase 3 show an overall positive sentiment and no major issues are brought up, the proposal may be submitted on-chain for the formal voting. Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\n\n\n### Exceptions to the Framework\n\n**Governance Council**\n\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \"fast-track\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\n\n**Core Developers**\n\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\n\n\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\n\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \n\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\n\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\n\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\n\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":13,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:16:21.430Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\\n\\n\\n### Exceptions to the Framework\\n\\n**Governance Council**\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \\\"fast-track\\\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\\n\\n**Core Developers**\\n\\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\\n\\n\\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\\n\\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \\n\\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\\n\\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\\n\\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\\n\\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\\n\\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\\n\"}"],"links":null,"has_poll":true,"canvas_action":null,"canvas_session":null,"canvas_hash":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:16:21.436Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T01:10:16.423Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-03T08:20:49.073Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2023-05-08T09:16:21.351Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2023-05-14T07:27:22.977Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"keplr-ethereum","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

ECP-0: Proposals to Advance Governance and Support the Growth of Evmos DAO and the Network Ecosystem\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** The following proposals are the culmination of thousands of hours of research and calculated deliberation. I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \n\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \n\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\n\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\n\n---\n\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \n\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \n\n---\n\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \n\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \\n\\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \\n\\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \\n\\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\\n\\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \\n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\\n\\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\\n\\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \\n\\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n\\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \\n\\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\\n\\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \\n\\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

We Are\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nWe are Flipside Crypto, a data analytics, growth, & governance organization operating across a number of Web3 ecosystems.\n\nAs strong believers in both the Evmos community and the future of Cosmos & Ethereum, Flipside is excited about the potential of becoming contributors and growth partners for the DAO.\n\nWith the support of Evmos core, Evmos DAO, and the community, we’ll aim to bring queryable on-chain data as a public good, deep analytics & insights, professionalized governance, and growth to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nTo that end, Flipside is seeking feedback from the Evmos community on our plans to create curated Evmos data, deliver a Community Analytics program, and provide direct DAO contributions.\n\nOur data can be accessed for free by builders and analysts for use in dashboards, insights, and application development. This data will be maintained by Flipside and made available in the Flipside Crypto platform. Our platform provides a SQL query editor, data visualization studio, API, and SDK, all delivered as a public good to the ecosystem.\n\nGoals for Evmos\n\nFlipside's contributions to Evmos have three main goals:\n\nFree & Open Data: by creating curated data sets and robust data pipelines, back to the genesis block. Our current data sets are available on our application and SDK as a public good to our partner ecosystems. As such, they can be leveraged to power external dashboards, website visuals, as well as to inform discussions across the entire community, from Commonwealth to Discord to Telegram.\n\nAnalytics Insights, Tools, & User Growth: By working directly with the core team, community, and DAO, we find the most pressing questions & needs from across these groups and build solutions via our Community Analytics programs. Flipside has supported 59,745 unique analysts contributing to efforts on our platform and has a unique set of talent internally.

are a team of 3 IT guys, with a 13-years of background in the IT business and 7-years in blockchain development.\n\nWe are located in Switzerland\n\nWe develop web3 Dapps and provide high quality infrastructure for public blokchain/Dapps on various networks.\n\nFurthermore, we sincerely believe in a more decentralized world, and we work under that premise.\n\nBackground\n\nWe are in the evmos community since day one, we maintain several nodes and one archive node (thanks god for the v9 ahah)\n\nwe have already done some work as a b2v provider for a reputable team in the ecosystem, I don't want to expose them but if they want i gonna update the post:)\n\nWe are personally exposed on the evmos token too, skin in the game as usual.\n\nAll our product use our bare-metal infra locate in OVH on different localization, we planned to move all that stuff in Switzerland soon.\n\nWhat we've already done\n\n.Nuxian payment – noncustodial and account abstracted smart contract for business payment.\n\n.Nuxian Unbounding Rescue – An app who front run the hacker at block +1 of the unbounding period. We are going to update it to be faster, and we plan to use authz module. That project already saved a bunch of k$.\n\n.Nuxian Node / Archive Node – we provide and maintain several nodes on evmos and different network\n\n.Nuxian Bot – that a discord/Twitter/XMPP/whatever you want Bot, but it has access to many event listeners that can be trigger by the user or be subscribed by the other one. It could do many tasks actually we use it too for community management and recognition.\n\n.Nuxian Validator – we already run a bunch of validators on several chains, but we don't have enought evmos to run one. That's hard to start a community when you're a tech team :) .\n\n.Nuxian erc20 to ibc converter – we have created a public tori erc20 to ibc token.\n\n. Nuxian Castle keeper – that's a token/nft gatekeeper for any resource you want. We use it to protect our RPC access, but you could use that for many other resources.\n\nWhat we do now\n\nTwo project are in the concept pipe :\n\n. Nuxian portofolio rebalancer – That going to be as the title say a rebalancer with a multiple variable, like copy x wallet or split in  X % in different token like EVMOS ATOM OSMO.

Unfortunately, stake.tax is having issues with it's source data API for EVMOS, due to the recent upgrade of the network.\n\nMy understanding is that <pagination.offset> argument seems to have no effect, always returning a result of \"0\". If an address has more than 100 transactions it causes the source data API to crash.\n\nThe creator of stake.tax mentioned that he has posted on the Evmos discord looking for assistance. I am posting here on commonwealth for visibility in hopes that we can get some help to restore services. With the need for filing 2022 taxes, I am completely reliant on stake.tax to obtain my transactions.\n\nI don't want to post the stake.tax creators username publicly here without his consent. I am not member of the stake.tax team, I am a near daily user of stake.tax and trying to help him in his search for help. A validator/developer/anyone...\n\nI will share a link to this post with him in his discord. Here is an invite to stake.tax Discord (valid for 7 days) --> https://discord.gg/w4waJ9JW There is discussion on this issue in the Evmos channel in the stake.tax discord.\n\n*On a side note, I am still baffled that not a single Cosmos ecosystem explorer has export transactions to csv functionality.

It can also help the development of evmos and the development of the cosmos ecological project.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"links":null,"has_poll":null,"canvas_action":null,"canvas_session":null,"canvas_hash":null,"created_at":"2023-01-12T02:29:20.125Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T10:36:39.262Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-01-13T15:37:03.048Z","Address":{"id":92528,"address":"evmos1xfzw7m3ktfkxpnllvkctz9v9j3tvch42wplsjh","chain":"evmos","verified":"2023-01-12T02:03:44.936Z","keytype":null,"name":"Thinker","last_active":"2023-01-12T02:29:20.142Z","user_id":81122,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":78404,"wallet_id":"keplr-ethereum","UserId":81122},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1474,"name":"6.

everyone,\n\nThis thread details all things related to the v10 upgrade to the Evmos network. Please review and share your thoughts with us. We are looking forward to the next upgrade.\n\nDescription\n\nMalte Herrmann, Evmos Core Team (Author)\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos Mainnet software upgrade at block height 9,495,000  from its current version v9.1.0  to v10.0.0 .\n\nMotivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our Software Upgrade Guide .\n\nImpact\n\nOn a high level, the v10.0.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\nUpdate Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.7, IBC-Go to v5.2.0 and Ethermint to v0.20.0\n\nAutomatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving\n\nSupport for ERC20 token transfers via IBC\n\nERC20 proposals to register ERC20 tokens and Cosmos coins now can receive multiple denominations\n\nPrioritized mempool support for Cosmos and Ethereum txs\n\nEIP-1559 support for native Cosmos transactions\n\nEIP-712 fixes for all major Cosmos messages (eg: MsgGrant for restake support)\n\nAdd Ledger support to the evmosd CLI\n\nEthereum Tx indexer\n\nThe funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated\n\nIntroduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)\n\nEIP-712 fixes for the vesting module\n\nAdd a default file store listener for a basic implementation of ADR-038: State Listening\n\nUpdate default node snapshot interval to 5000 seconds\n\nUpdate Ledger supported algorithms to only consist of EthSecp256k1\n\nA full changelog can be found here .\n\nNOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\n\nTesting\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found here . Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":"","topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":35,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-13T23:58:32.250Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1my3w8f69wxqajwj64lt07ws97u4em4rjcvvwr8\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"mmm\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-13T23:00:25.570Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Greetings everyone,\\\\n\\\\nThis thread details all things related to the v10 upgrade to the Evmos network.

For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\n\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally.

everyone! \n\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes. This is a good example of the importance of testing upgrades in a testnet environment. The main issue that we discovered was that Metamask transactions could not be submitted, because the UI didn't allow large differences between the base fee and the min gas price. \n\nThis thread is following up with scheduling the `v6.0.1` software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000\n](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200 ) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v6.0.1` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters.\n* Allow Metamask transactions with min gas price\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `20,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5922-evmos-software-upgrade-v601).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":6,"read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-28T20:52:29.676Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-17T14:01:27.792Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"Hey everyone! \\n\\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes.

I'm opening up this thread on scheduling the next software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v5.0.0` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `25,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5467-evmos-software-upgrade-v500).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Rejected","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":2,"read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-15T09:17:12.625Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-10T13:14:21.547Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Author\\n\\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\\n\\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at bloc height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

Evmos community,\n\nWe are launching a new proposal to extend the Evmos liquidity incentive on SpaceFi in order to continue to drive the Evmos ecosystem forward. At the same time, we are also solving some issues in the current incentive program. Looking forward to your feedbacks.\n\nSummary\n\nOn 2023.01.25, Evmos community passed Proposal 109 to grant 1M Evmos liquidity incentive on SpaceFi for 90 days, growing Evmos liquidity to a maximum of $2.6M. It allows Evmos native liquidity and trading volumes to outpace Osmosis for a long time. As SpaceFi launched on zkSync Era on 03.27 and connected to Evmos, the per day trading volume of the Evmos pairs was once over $1M. The previous incentive program will end on 05.21 (it may actually be a bit longer as some rewards are refunded) and we plan to apply for a new round of 1M EVMOS incentive to extend SpaceFi's Evmos liquidity incentive to continue to drive the Evmos ecosystem forward.\n\nReview\n\nIn Proposal 109 , we proposed Concentrated Liquidity, xEVMOS module, LP Bonding and Ecosystem Building. And we got some feedbacks during the previous incentive program.\n\n1. Concentrated Liquidity\n\nEvmos liquidity is mainly concentrated in EVMOS-axlUSDC, EVMOS-ATOM, EVMOS-axlETH pairs, reducing fragmentation, with EVMOS-axlUSDC liquidity reaching $900k at one point.\n\n2. xEVMOS Module and LP Bonding\n\nThe xEVMOS Module is designed to prevent dumping of EVMOS incentive. In fact, currently around 4% of xEvmos rewards choose to unbond instantly (50% of which are returned to the incentive multisig at around 15,500 EVMOS), with the rest unlocked via 30 days. LP Bonding plays a role in incentivizing long-term liquidity and avoiding mercenary liquidity, with 75% of of LPs opted for 7 or 14 day bonding.\n\n3. Ecosystem Building\n\nSpaceFi fully launched on the Evmos mainnet, along with Evmos liquidity incentive from 02.21, and then fully launched on zkSync Era on 27 March. The SPACE token price rose from $0.05 to as high as $0.50, contributing 50%-85% to the APR of the Evmos incentive. By connecting Evmos and zkSync Era, SpaceFi has also brought Layer2 narratives and many EVM users to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nAbstract\n\nWe are excited to see the community owned DEX Forge launch and focus on V3 concentrated liquidity and liquid staking assets. As a differentiator, we believe that V2 liquidity and non-LSD assets are still needed on the Evmos ecosystem. In order to maintain the existing Evmos liquidity on SpaceFi and to avoid liquidity fragmentation due to homogenous competition with Forge, we will maintain the previous incentivized pairs and move out less capital efficient Evmos pairs such as axlBTC, OSMOS, EVMOS to further optimize liquidity. In addition, given that stEVMOS has started to be widely adopted, we'd like to use stEVMOS as an incentive, replacing xEVMOS.\n\nThe incentive program will last for 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days.\n\nFund Utilization Plan\n\nMAJOR：50%，5952 EVMOS/day + 3274 SPACE/day\n\nEVMOS/ATOM：3571 EVMOS/day + 1964 SPACE/day\n\nEVMOS/axlETH：2381 EVMOS/day + 1310 SPACE/day\n\nSTABLE：35%，4166 EVMOS/day + 2291 SPACE/day\n\nEVMOS/axlUSDC：4166 EVMOS/day + 2291 SPACE/day\n\nMINOR：15%, 1786 EVMOS/day + 982 SPACE/day\n\nEVMOS/SPACE：1786 EVMOS/day + 982 SPACE/day\n\nTVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 55% (no bonding) - 110% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 27.5% (no bonding) - 55% (14 days unbonding)\n\ncheck the detailed chart\n\n1. The above data is based on the price of EVMOS and SPACE on 2023.05.10, without LP Fee APR yet.\n\n2. 15% of EVMOS incentive will be allocated to EVMOS-SPACE pair, and SpaceFi will provide SPACE incentive equal to 15% of the total EVMOS incentive.\n\n3. The reward weight for each pair can be adjusted each 21 days based on liquidity & volume data. And the emission of SPACE may be adjusted to match the price changes.\n\nMultisig Group (3 of 5)\n\nTBD\n\nThanks to those who give feedbacks on SpaceFi's liquidity incentive and overall development to help us improve!","kind":"link","stage":"Discussion","url":"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/109","topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":105,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-05-11T19:04:56.105Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos1mk98x7jvsmmnymlypphmyddug7wpc4ur0zralz\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_name\\\":\\\"cryptoallen|spacefi.io\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b082f11f-f16f-436f-8d4c-e6539f95d1f2.png\\\",\\\"_id\\\":95868,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-05-11T18:40:24.766Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Dear Evmos community,\\\\n\\\\nWe are launching a new proposal to extend the Evmos liquidity incentive on \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.spacefi.io/\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"SpaceFi\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" in order to continue to drive the Evmos ecosystem forward.

In addition, given that stEVMOS has started to be widely adopted, we'd like to use stEVMOS as an incentive, replacing xEVMOS.\\\\n\\\\nThe incentive program will last for 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days.\\\\n\\\\nFund Utilization Plan\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"MAJOR：50%，5952 EVMOS/day + 3274 SPACE/day\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEVMOS/ATOM：3571 EVMOS/day + 1964 SPACE/day\\\\nEVMOS/axlETH：2381 EVMOS/day + 1310 SPACE/day\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"STABLE：35%，4166 EVMOS/day + 2291 SPACE/day\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEVMOS/axlUSDC：4166 EVMOS/day + 2291 SPACE/day\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"MINOR：15%, 1786 EVMOS/day + 982 SPACE/day\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEVMOS/SPACE：1786 EVMOS/day + 982 SPACE/day\\\\n\\\\nTVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 55% (no bonding) - 110% (14 days unbonding)\\\\nTVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 27.5% (no bonding) - 55% (14 days unbonding)\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hAQRvF-YWhgQrFvKSNr2exCfjUlE3pN4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109681222082450119292&rtpof=true&sd=true\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"check the detailed chart\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n1.

DAO ( Telegram , Twitter )\n\nOrbital Apes ( Website , Twitter )\n\nForge ( Telegram , Twitter )\n\nSummary\n\nIntroducing Inferno - a 12 week long incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in Forge , the community owned DEX of Evmos. The Forge team is requesting 3,000,000 Evmos to fund this initiative. The program aims to solve the liquidity issue on Evmos but also leverages the potential of concentrated liquidity and staked assets. Such a highly attractive incentive program combined with concentrated liquidity and LST has never been done in the Cosmos ecosystem before. Potentially making Forge the most capital efficient DEX within the Cosmos!\n\nGoal\n\nCreate sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge but also raise awareness about DeFi on Cosmos with solidity-based applications.\n\nAbstract\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. By incentivizing staked assets (such as stEVMOS, stATOM, rETH) people will earn staking rewards while providing liquidity and participate in the incentive program; no DEX on Cosmos has done this yet which is a unique value proposition of Forge. On top of that highly concentrated pools can be created between the native and staked asset (such as stATOM/ATOM) with limited impermanent loss risks but lot of revenue potential.\n\nAction plan and Pools\n\nThe full incentive program has a duration of 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days. Before each period the incentive rewards will be liquid staked to stEVMOS and rolled into the 21 days program. As a result of liquid staking, the Stride DAO council committed to add 1,000 STRD/day to the incentive program.\n\nWe selected 7 pools in total and put them into three different incentive tiers. Our goal is to avoid fragmentation and get deep base liquidity on Evmos. The requested daily emissions equal to 7.9% of the current staking emissions. Users providing liquidity will potentially earn staking rewards, liquidity emissions from this program and LP fees. To find a rough estimate of the APR at $1M TVL per pool, please open the spreadsheet . Keep in mind that if the TVL is below $1M TVL, the APR is higher and vice versa.\n\nTier 1 - 9,286 EVMOS daily emission per pool\n\nstEVMOS/stATOM\n\nstEVMOS/axlUSDC (+ 600 Stride incentives)\n\nstEVMOS/axlRETH\n\nTier 2 - 2,589 EVMOS daily emission per pool\n\nstEVMOS/STRD (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n\nstATOM/ATOM (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n\nTier 3 - 1,339 EVMOS daily emissions per pool\n\naxlUSDC/ceUSDT\n\naxlRETH/axlWETH\n\nVesting\n\nThe time-vesting uniswap staker is a fork of the Uniswap v3 staker that adds a linear vesting period for positions to receive the full amounts of the accrued rewards. Linear vesing of rewards is intended to prevent ultra-concentrated liquidity from gaming the incentives and extract most of the rewards. You can read more about it on this post .\n\n(image)\n\nWhile the incentive rewards accrue proportional to liquidity , in the same way that trading fees do, the vested fraction increases linearly while the position is in range. Rewards that have not been accrued to positions not being staked or out of range or withdrawn before end of vesting period, would be rolled over to the next cycle.\n\nRewards claiming\n\nVesting is calculated when you unstake the position. So, when you unstake the position, the contract checks if the liquidity was active for longer than the vesting period. If it is, you get all rewards for the amount of active liquidity you provided in the time period. if it's not it gives you the ratio of timespent/vesting period*(rewards received if there was no vesting period).\n\nTimeline\n\nIncentives can kick off once they're approved through governance and after Revert completes atleast the first two milestones of their funding proposal. We estimate the week of the 22nd May.\n\nAdjustments\n\nIf the liquidity of a pool does not match our expectation we might make adjustments on the allocation per pool as we learn during this program. Each change will be discussed on Forge’s social channel and communicated upfront.\n\nDependencies\n\nRevert Milestone 1 and 2\n\nERC20 Registration for Axelar rETH and wstETH\n\nMultisig 4/6\n\nAll the funds will eventually flow to the liquidity providers.\n\nLPX | DAO\n\nGeorge | DAO\n\nCtrlAltApe | OrbitalApes\n\nJohn | Stride\n\nRok | Qubelabs\n\nLuis | Interbloc\n\nSafe Deployment Address: evmos:0xb75ce906a270F7680Faf1A2F6D70F4f28061B87a\n\nHighlighting Engaged Community Members\n\nSpecial thanks for input & feedback on this program from Luis (Interbloc), _Nick (active community member) and John Galt (Stride).","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":"","topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":597,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-05-03T17:19:35.250Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos1q2r0ljt3zd59fnxvk6amfdddqg7y806ghhxkct\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_name\\\":\\\"GV | Swiss Staking\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cf5059f6-f2da-4abd-ac6d-8153a96bab47.png\\\",\\\"_id\\\":56179,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-05-02T13:11:48.415Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"# Inferno - An incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in Forge\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"## Authors\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n- Evmos DAO ([Telegram](https://t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO))\\\\n- Orbital Apes ([Website](https://www.orbitalapes.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes))\\\\n- Forge ([Telegram](http://t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex))\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"## Summary\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nIntroducing \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"**Inferno**\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" - a 12 week long incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in [Forge](https://app.forge.trade/#/swap), the community owned DEX of Evmos.

Linear vesing of rewards is intended to prevent ultra-concentrated liquidity from gaming the incentives and extract most of the rewards.  You can read more about it on this [post](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).\\\\n\\\\n![Untitled](Inferno%20-%20An%20incentive%20program%20to%20bootstrap%20liquid%20a556e7c2e2f14aa3baa75ad529ead9de/Untitled.png)\\\\n\\\\nWhile the incentive rewards accrue proportional to \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"*liquidity*\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\", in the same way that trading fees do, the vested fraction increases linearly while the position is in range.

So, when you unstake the position, the contract checks if the liquidity was active for longer than the vesting period.

DAO ( Telegram , Twitter )\n\nForge ( Telegram , Twitter )\n\nMario | Revert Finance ( Website , Twitter )\n\nSummary\n\nThe Forge team recognizes the valuable tools and resources for v3 that Revert Finance would bring to the Evmos ecosystem and have been in talks for deployment. This proposal aims to formalize the partnership and commitment to deploy, which will also allow the start of the incentives programs on Forge through their unique time-vested incentives contracts .\n\nIntroduction to Revert Finance\n\nRevert Finance is a well-known protocol in the DeFi landscape for their unparalleled tools, data and analytics, and resources to optimize Univ3 liquidity positions, empowering users to make the most of their liquidity. Valuable analytics such as a position’s PNL, ROI, impermanent loss, historical data, amount invested, etc., provides great insights that are easily understood by users.\n\nRevert has a solid track record, with successful collaborations with Uniswap deployments on other networks, such as Polygon and Optimism . We encourage everyone to watch this video to learn more and get detailed insights on Revert’s tools.\n\nTools\n\nPosition Analytics: Check and easily track the performance of your positions on Forge. Info and screenshot here .\n\nTop positions: The Top Positions section shows a list of the top active positions based on how they are performing overall on Evmos. Info and screenshot here .\n\nIncentives: Revert has an incentives section that displays the currently running incentives programs on the Uniswap v3 canonical staker contract, as well as the time-vested staker contract. Uniswap v3 position dashboards automatically detect and display the rewards accrued by each position. Info and screenshot here .\n\nInitiator: The initiator helps users initiate LP positions. Opening positions on concentrated liquidity AMMs requires making important decisions about price ranges, which can be greatly aided with historical data and analysis. Info and screenshot here .\n\nAuto-compounding: The Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued fees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to incentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas costs. Info and screenshot here .\n\nPosition Management: The position management interface is available from the account and position pages, where LPs can Add or Withdraw Liquidity and Claim Fees. Within this interface, you can also swap tokens to align with your desired ratio when adding liquidity, withdrawing, or claiming!\n\nMilestones and Deliverables\n\nDeliverables refer to the tangible or intangible items that are completed by Revert Finance. These deliverables are grouped together into milestones. The team at Revert Finance has set a target of completing all the deliverables within ~8 weeks, with the goal of demonstrating a long-term commitment to the project. Milestone 1 is prioritized by Revert to help with the roll out of Forge incentives. If approved, the project start date is planned for May 1st.\n\nMilestone 1 - Incentive Tools [25% release 1 months after completion]\n\nVested v3staker contract: Deployment of the vested v3 staker contract on EVMOS\n\nVested v3staker frontend: allowing anyone to stake positions and the creation of incentive programs for Forge pools.\n\nMilestone 2 - Analytics and Indexing [25% release 2 months after completion]\n\nAnalytics for existing positions: LPs are able to track PNL, APR, Fees etc for their positions\n\nIndexing of top positions: Users are able to browse and explore the catalog of existing positions across Forge pools\n\nMilestone 3- Position Management and Auto-compounder [25% release 3 months after completion]\n\nInitiator / backtester for Forge pools: Users are able to backtest and create new positions using the revert interface\n\nv3utils contract and frontend: Utilities for LPs, swap and mint, move ranges, etc..\n\nAuto-compounder: Deployment and support for the auto-compounder contract and protocol including auto-compounding bots\n\nMilestone 4 - Keplr integration [25% release 4 months after completion]\n\nIntegration of Keplr wallet\n\nFunding Amount\n\nThe requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the Revert Finance team if the milestones and deliverables are met.

BASED ON COMMUNITY FEEDBACK**\n\n- 4/7/23: Doubled the request amount to 2M\n- 4/7/23: Added quarterly reports\n- 4/7/23: Highlighting that the only generated rewards are LP + liquid staking\n- 4/7/23: Added Luisqa to the multisig\n\n=================================\n\n## Author\n\n- Evmos DAO [Telegram](t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\n- Forge [Telegram](t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to provide liquidity of the Evmos treasury to the stEVMOS/EVMOS pair. We request 2M Evmos, with 1M Evmos allocated for liquid staking. All funds (1M stEVMOS and 1M EVMOS) will be added to the Forge stEVMOS/EVMOS liquidity pool (~600k USD). It will be actively managed by the DAO, OA + a trusted and active community member. \n\n## Abstract\n\nThis initiative is designed to enhance the growth and long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. \n\nIt involves requesting 2M Evmos from the Evmos treasury and staking 1M Evmos in the liquid staking module of Stride. The DAO will then allocate 1M stEVMOS and 1M EVMOS to the Forge liquidity pool. This will improve the liquid staked token liquidity of Evmos in the market, and the allocation will be monitored and adjusted based on market conditions and community input.\n\nRewards Distribution and DAO Sustainability is another key initiative. The rewards generated from liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to the multisig wallet. A portion of the rewards will be used to cover the operational costs of the DEX to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. This includes development, maintenance, moderation, promotion, marketing, legal and compliance duties. The remaining rewards will be allocated for Forge bounties. Bounties are a common way for decentralized exchanges to incentivize developers and security researchers to contribute to the platform. Here are some potential bounties: \n\n- Feature bounties: A feature bounty program incentivizes developers to contribute new features or improvements to the platform's codebase.\n- Education bounties: An education bounty program incentivizes users to create educational content about the platform, such as blog posts, videos, or tutorials.\n- Bug bounties: A bug bounty program rewards security researchers for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities or bugs in the platform's codebase.\n\nWe value transparency and accountability in all aspects of our operations, including our bounty programs. As part of our commitment to transparency, we will provide quarterly reports detailing the bounties we have offered and the costs associated with Forge.\n\nTo ensure the security and integrity of staked funds and community assets, Univ3 liquidity pools will be utilized, which have a proven track record of security and reliability on Ethereum. Acknowledging the potential risks associated with the liquid staking provider Stride, which has undergone multiple audits and implemented IBC limits to minimize vulnerabilities. As a comparison, the ATOM accelerator program also liquid staked around 60k ATOM (~600k USD) by using Stride. **Additionally, Stride has partnered with Forge and committed to incentivize pools on Forge with their own governance tokens.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, the Evmos community can expect improved utility and value from the treasury funds, increased market liquidity, and a more sustainable DAO and Forge DEX model. A LSD pool by the treasury, along with the security measures in place, will contribute to the overall growth and success of the Evmos ecosystem. \n\n## Stride\n\nThe Stride DAO will be providing incentives as soon as technically possible. If the community provides treasury liquidity of stEVMOS/EVMOS it allows stride to incentivize different pools (like stEVMOS/USDC) instead which brings more external TVL into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n## Timeframe\n\nAfter careful consideration and discussion, the general agreement is to pool these funds into a liquidity pool for a period of 6 months. A follow up proposal will be made to renew after the specified period. If the renewal is rejected, the 2M Evmos will be returned. The requested funds only provision liquidity to Forge. \n\nSide note: If a vault provider that is trusted deploys on Evmos, it could be worth considering entrusting the management of the LP position to the vault.\n\n## About Forge\n\nThe Evmos DAO and OA teamed up and delivered a fully UniV3 compatible DEX on Evmos. Forge is fully community owned and funded. \n\nWhat we offer is: \n\n- No investment token\n- No initial protocol fees\n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset (coming soon)\n- One click liquid staking button (coming soon)\n\n[See full proposal here](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/113)\n\n## Multisig 4/5\n\nThe position must be adjusted on a regular basis since stEVMOS accrues value against EVMOS daily. Therefore, it is important to keep the multisig simple and effective. \n\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- 0xCtrlAltApe | Orbital Apes\n- Luisqa | Zenith Station\n- LPX | DAO\n- GV | DAO\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":439,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-04-06T16:57:52.808Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos1q2r0ljt3zd59fnxvk6amfdddqg7y806ghhxkct\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_name\\\":\\\"GV | Swiss Staking\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cf5059f6-f2da-4abd-ac6d-8153a96bab47.png\\\",\\\"_id\\\":56179,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-03-22T08:51:08.534Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"## Author\\n\\n- Evmos DAO [Telegram](t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\\n- Forge [Telegram](t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal aims to provide liquidity of the Evmos treasury to the stEVMOS/EVMOS pair.

see the full, properly formatted version of the text, here .\n\nOverview\n\nBuilt by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic\n\nhub for information and tooling that makes navigating the rapidly growing Interchain\n\neasier for both new and old users alike. At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently,\n\n“Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities,\n\neducational resources, NFT collections, communities, Dapps and tools each reside in\n\ntheir own remote corners of the ecosystem.\n\nICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified,\n\nmulti-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is\n\nparamount to Cosmos, and an interconnected web3 world in general, gaining mass\n\nadoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign\n\non the Spark IBC platform, found here, https://sparkibc.zone. To keep things concise,\n\nmore info about ICI itself can be found on the Spark campaign page, and through\n\nour public beta at Interchaininfo.zone .\n\nThe following funding request is part of a Multi-Chain Governance effort by\n\nSpark IBC to bolster the campaign for ICI. This means that a similar prop has or will\n\nbe requested of a number of other IBC connected chains.\n\nRequest\n\nWe at Spark IBC are requesting 1% of community pool funds (capped at\n\n$20,000) from a number of chains, including Evmos, to contribute to The Interchain\n\nInfo Campaign.\n\n 50% of issued funds will be donated alongside other funding sources,\n\nlike private donations on the Spark platform, directly to ICI for uses\n\noutlined here .\n\nThe remaining 50% will ultimately go back to the community, as it will\n\nbe used for incentivizing content on ICI related to Evmos and its\n\necosystem.\n\n For Evmos, this amounts to a total of 58521 $EVMOS or about\n\n$20,000.\n\nEach network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based\n\non their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled\n\n“[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to\n\nrecognize users & organizations for their contributions to the Interchain. For\n\nexample, you can see The Hubs entry as a result of Prop #202, here,\n\nhttps://sparkibc.zone/leaderboard.\n\nSpending Details\n\nBase Contribution\n\nIn addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we are currently working off of the\n\nfollowing rough breakdown of the way all funds not pledged to the incentives\n\nprogram will be spent. Our current version, a work-in-progress, can be found here but\n\nplease note, this is apt to change at any point during development.\n\nIncentives Program\n\nAs stated, 50% of the requested ~58k $EVMOS will be used exclusively to\n\nincentivize content specific to Evmos and its ecosystem on the Index and Resource\n\nhub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little\n\nincome while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also\n\nensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a\n\nvery direct way.\n\nPlease note : As outlined in the full text for this prop, we intend to run this program with tight oversight such that it won't be able to be gamed, and the funds will only be spent as needed, meaning for some smaller chains that may not have a ton going on yet, the funds will simply last longer!\n\nPlease see the full text, linked at the top, for additional details on all of these points, as well as a brief FAQ.","kind":"link","stage":"discussion","url":"https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Evmos%20Community%20Pool%20Funding%20for%20ICI.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=CEA302ACE80DC404571A%2F20230328%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230328T204240Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=27e2bf54e7a9ea668829b93248cda49d4e918889d0455202ea560a5eb6e622b8","topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":168,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-03-28T20:48:14.233Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos1nfnxm606vgmpgt8unvkrl5t0ke0dapncaxuztk\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_id\\\":null,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-03-28T20:22:10.951Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Please see the full, properly formatted version of the text, \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://sparkibc.s3.filebase.com/InterchainInfo/Evmos%20Community%20Pool%20Funding%20for%20ICI.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=CEA302ACE80DC404571A%2F20230328%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230328T204240Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=27e2bf54e7a9ea668829b93248cda49d4e918889d0455202ea560a5eb6e622b8\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"here\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".\\\\n\\\\nOverview\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Built by Spark IBC, Interchain Info (ICI) is a truly multi-chain & chain-agnostic\\\\nhub for information and tooling that makes navigating the rapidly growing Interchain\\\\neasier for both new and old users alike.

Author\n\n- Evmos DAO\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal requests a spend of **3,298,484 Evmos** from the Community Pool to establish DAO Liquidity of EVMOS/JUNO within both ecosystems.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is the mirror of the proposal on JUNO (PROP XY) to request 1M JUNO. If only one proposal passes then the community spend shall be returned to the corresponding community pool. If both proposals pass, 1,783,333 EVMOS would be directly swapped for 500,000 JUNO from the Juno Community Pool. This is an approximate value of $450,000. Afterwards, both multisig parties will add funds to the EVMOS/JUNO pair on each ecosystem. This does not create sell pressure in any way. \n\nBoth parties agrees that this liquidity shall not be sold or removed from the liquidity pool for a minimum of 4 year. Liquidity is owned by each DAO; Juno DAO manages the pool on the Juno side and Evmos DAO on the Evmos side. A governance text proposal is required to remove or modify the LP position in any way.\n\n**Main benefit for community owned liquidity:**\n\n- Laying a sustainable foundation for liquidity\n- Long term alignment between Evmos and Juno. Opens the door for future collaborations\n- Diversifies treasury in non native token; allowing both chains to benefit from each other's strengths and grow together.\n- Generating revenue; LP fees flows back to the community / DAO\n\n**Main risks for community owned liquidity**: \n\n- Impermanent Loss\n- Smart Contract Risks (can be mitigated on the Evmos side by putting liquidity into UniV3/V2)\n\n## **No Protocol Market Sale Allowed**\n\nAfter careful consideration and discussion, the general agreement is to pool these funds into a liquidity pool for a period of 2 years. We recommend that the terms of the agreement be reviewed and renewed after the specified period. It is crucial to note that in the event of a lack of consensus from both the community, any market sale of community funds is strictly prohibited. In such a scenario, the funds can be used for the following if approved by the community:\n\n- Incentive programs\n- Lending/Borrowing\n- Grants\n- Swapping Evmos back to Juno\n\nThis is in line with our commitment to ethical and responsible financial practices.\n\n## Conversion Rate\n\nThe conversion rate takes circulating supply, total cap, inflation and token unlocks into consideration. The party with more aggressive inflation (in this case Evmos) shall compensate the other for dilution. The compensation cannot be pooled since it unbalances the liquidity pool. Instead it will move to the community pool of Juno where it cannot be sold for 4 years. This way we achieve a fair and one-time swap execution between two community pools. Afterwards both parties are exposed to the same upside, downside and IL risks. \n\n- The Evmos community swaps 1,783,333 Evmos (1,515,151 Evmos for pooling + 268,182 Evmos for dilution compensation) for 500,000 Juno\n- The Juno community pools (on their ecosystem) 1,515,151 Evmos with 500,000 Juno. The difference (1,783,333 Evmos - 1,515,151 Evmos) flows to the Juno community pool. This is the compensation for the more aggressive inflation on Evmos.\n- The Evmos community pools 1,515,151 Evmos with 500,000 Juno on their ecosystem. The Evmos community itself must not be compensated for their own dilution.\n- The total request for Evmos is 1,515,151 * 2 + 268,182 ****= **3,298,484 Evmos**\n- The total request for Juno is 500,000 * 2 = **1,000,000 Juno**\n\n| | Evmos | Juno |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Circulating Supply | 442M | 97M |\n| multiplier | 2.26 | 1.92 |\n| Total Supply | 1,000M | 186M |\n| | | |\n| Inflation ratio (Evmos base) | 100% | 1.92 / 2.26 * 100 = 84.95% |\n| Inflation ratio (Juno base) | 2.26/1.92 * 100 = 117.7% | 100% |\n| Price Ratio | 0.33 | 3.33 |\n| | | |\n| Pooling per ecosystem | (500,000 Juno / 0.33) = 1,515,151 Evmos | 500,000 Juno |\n| Dilution Compensation Juno side | (500,000 / 0.33 * 1.177) = 1,783,333 - 1,515,151 = 268,182 Evmos compensation | 0 |\n| Dilution Compensation Evmos side | only Juno side must be compensated | 0 |\n| TOTAL COMMUNITY ASK | 1,515,151 Evmos * 2 + 268,182 Evmos = 3,298,484 Evmos | 500,000 Juno * 2 = 1,000,000 Juno |\n\n## Exchange\n\nDEX selection is up to the community in a follow up proposal. The multisig on the Evmos side will manage the LP position where EACH action must pass governance. Same applies on the Juno side.\n\nSo this is how it would look like (on the Evmos side)\n\n- Request 3M from community pool\n- Swap with Juno\n- New text proposal for DEX selection (UniV3 fork, Pangolin or whoever is interested)\n- Based on proposal output the multisig will provision the liquidity to the winner\n\n## Rewards\n\nAll generated rewards remain in the wallet until defined otherwise by governance. \n\n## Multisig\n\n4/6 threshold on Evmos\n\n- 2 DAO\n- 2 VAL\n- 2 JUNO / EVMOS COMMUNITY MEMBERS\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":117,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-03-20T07:58:30.685Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos1q2r0ljt3zd59fnxvk6amfdddqg7y806ghhxkct\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_name\\\":\\\"GV | Swiss Staking\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cf5059f6-f2da-4abd-ac6d-8153a96bab47.png\\\",\\\"_id\\\":56179,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-03-20T07:54:45.621Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"## Author\\n\\n- Evmos DAO\\n- Juno Growth DAO\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis proposal requests a spend of 3,000,000 EVMOS from the Community Pool to establish DAO Liquidity of EVMOS/JUNO within both ecosystems.\\n\\n## Abstract\\n\\nThis proposal is the mirror of the proposal on JUNO (PROP XY) to request 841,005 JUNO.

part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative with Regen Network, we would like to discuss bringing Evmos’s carbon emission to net zero (#EvmosZERO) by employing community funds to offset Evmos's protocol validator set for the year 2022. This will be one of the first steps to kickstart ReFi on Evmos!\n\nAuthor\n\nNemus | Stakecito ( @stakecito )\n\nGhazni | Stakecito ( @ghazni1010 )\n\nAbstract\n\nDear Evmosians,\n\nwe propose to fund 79,750 $EVMOS (= USD $23,925 at $0.3 per $EVMOS) from the Evmos community pool to purchase and retire 7,975 Nature Carbon Ton (USD $3 a credit) on Regen marketplace at app.regen.network , to make the Evmos protocol carbon neutral for the year of 2022.\n\nRegen Network Development PBC commits to hold and stake the 79,750 $EVMOS for 12 months, beginning as soon as the Evmos tokens are sent from the multi-sig address. Any unspent $EVMOS will be returned to the Evmos community pool.\n\nAs you can see, this is an improved proposal version with a significantly reduced ask amount since we excluded CFCs (City Forest Credits) and added a 12-month Evmos price protection (courtesy of Regen Network Development PBC). We took a lot of community feedback into account. You can find the link to the previous Commonwealth discussions here . Target on-chain date: February 27th, 2022.\n\nMultisig committee:\n\n•   Nemus | Stakecito\n\n0x4F2f657E265d8aA9Ea75dB7d7137594C42ce69Dc\n\n•   LPX | Evmos DAO Governance\n\n0x02b8f20a5663c0679045ed9e6715b36c85b30f4b\n\n•   Dan | Qwoyn Validator\n\n0x4d696630877a0584e30866d1444859fb8d9E5956\n\n•   Pete | Regenerator\n\n0x0e722c4220bDaB54D15869f427969e9b7ecec5ca\n\n•   SR | Kalia Network\n\n0xa955B26102F89CaBaf8E0366478E948516F11039\n\nMultisig contract (3/5) / recipient address:\n\n0x2DE486f4CBC362A4BbD25968F88547f076B2C212\n\n#EvmosZERO - kicking off ReFi on Evmos!\n\nWhy is offsetting Evmos’s carbon emission important for Evmos? Why is ReFi on Evmos a huge opportunity going forward?\n\nWell, carbon credits are financial assets that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. The race is on!\n\nSome of the major Ethereum (VM) compatible blockchains, such as Polygon , offset their carbon emission by retiring $400,000 in carbon credits (104,794 tonnes) on KlimaDAO , a Polygon based ReFi market. The decision came after Polygon’s $20 Million pledge to become carbon negative in 2022.\n\nCelo , another EVM Layer-1, went a step further and is not only carbon negative by offsetting on Wren, but it is increasingly becoming the EVM-hub for ReFi by actively investing in projects and collaborating with existing players such as Toucan Protocol on Polygon and Regen Network on Cosmos.\n\nEvmos could position itself as one of the significant ReFi hubs for EVM-based projects by investing early into ReFi projects, which could spin off into its own grants category. Those that deploy on Evmos will eventually have the desire to do cross-chain transactions with other EVMs as well as access the Cosmos ecosystem via Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).\n\nAs a first step, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022. Evmos has its roots in Cosmos ( Cosmos Hub prop 44 ) and this would demonstrate to users, builders, investors, and all involved stakeholders in the space that strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem are possible (more in the section “Out co-operating the competition: an opportunity for Evmos & Regen”).\n\nCosmos ZERO, a partnership of Regen Network and the Interchain Foundation, is an initiative for Cosmos protocols and validators to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for their network validator node infrastructure and operations.\n\nCosmos ZERO Program: https://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10\n\nCosmos ZERO Carbon Footprint Analysis: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA/edit\n\nCosmos ZERO FAQs: https://regennetwork.notion.site/FAQ-7e738366e1ee428084838355ec1b6e8a\n\nAll calculations consider flight miles, offices, virtual CPUs, physical data centers, and location-based emissions factors for validator operations. *The “worst case scenario” carbon footprint was established based on a sampling taken of Regen Network’s own validators. The largest validator operation of the set emitted 25 tons of carbon per year, according to the PoS Carbon Calculator with their data applied. This standard is used to avoid underestimations.\n\nOut co-operating the competition: an opportunity for Evmos & Regen!\n\nEvmos is built using Cosmos SDK as a high-throughput PoS CometBFT chain and it is interoperable with the Cosmos ecosystem through the IBC, which naturally aligns well with Regen Network. Also, Evmos offers all the capabilities of Ethereum, Celo, or any other EVM-compatible chain. This is where Regen can be complementary, providing knowledge and resources to enable ReFi on the Evmos.\n\nWhat is the advantage for Evmos to partner and offset with Regen?\n\nSeveral Cosmos projects such as Osmosis, IXO, and CHEQD have committed through governance to offset their carbon emission & Stargaze already retired their carbon emission on Regen Network\n\nVarious other Cosmos projects have ongoing governance discussions to offset on Regen as well\n\nMany validators have joined the Cosmos ZERO initiative and are actively engaging with other projects and communities\n\nRegen Network is the leading ReFi project in the Cosmos ecosystem\n\nRegen Network is well connected among the ReFi communities in other ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, Solana, and co.\n\nWhat are some of the potential synergies between Evmos & Regen that could be addressed in future proposals?\n\nAdd $EVMOS to the allowed currency list for Regen Network\n\nBring NCTs and CFCs as ERC-20 to Evmos\n\nLaunch $EVMOS/$NCT & $REGEN/$NCT pools on Evmos dexes\n\nHelp the Evmos validator set to improve the climate impact of their node infrastructure and thereby reduce the carbon footprint\n\nRegen helped Evmos to push ReFi projects such as Gitcoin, supporting this on the Gitcoin end for many years\n\nEvmos could start where the most traction and product-market fit is and evolve from there. It’s obvious, that Evmos currently has strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem which it can build upon :\n\n$EVMOS highest volume is on Osmosis: volume & liquidity for EVMOS/OSMO pair is always in the top 10\n\nCosmonauts claimed a huge portion of the $EVMOS airdrop\n\nCosmos Hub funded Ethermint and thereby made Evmos possible\n\nCosmonauts are Evmos’s largest and oldest user base\n\nOffsetting on Regen is just the first step in this mutual partnership\n\nMotivation\n\nThe environmental cost of blockchain technology is often cited as a problem that needs to be tackled before widespread adoption. Proof of Work consensus algorithms, such as those in use by Bitcoin, create an arms race of computing power in order for a miner to be the first to create a new block and so obtain the reward.\n\nCosmos’ Proof of Stake validation system drastically improves on this by making this competition take place over attracting more delegation of stake from users. Validators are not required to perform deliberately complicated calculations and so can run on relatively low power machines. However, these machines are still required to be online 24/7 and perform calculations to confirm each block as it is generated. This results in a carbon footprint for each blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nBased on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Evmos is estimated to emit at most 7975 tons (= 7975 NCT) a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Thanks to new innovations from the Regen Network protocol, Cosmos ecosystem blockchains have the opportunity to offset carbon emissions directly within the ecosystem.\n\nRegen Network is a public proof-of-stake blockchain custom-built for global carbon accounting on the CosmosSDK. Regen’s infrastructure originates high-quality nature-based digital carbon in the Interchain economy, unlocking web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) and catalyzing solutions to the climate crisis.\n\nOffsetting Evmos’s carbon footprint on Regen Network\n\nOne carbon credit (e.g. Nature Carbon Ton / NCT) is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon emission. Regen Network offers Cosmos protocols to offset carbon emissions directly within the ecosystem.\n\nPurchase Nature Carbon Ton - NCT:\n\nRegen Network is launching Nature Carbon Ton credits (NCT) , a premium digital carbon basket of nature-based projects in cooperation with the Osmosis decentralized exchange.

Those that deploy on Evmos will eventually have the desire to do cross-chain transactions with other EVMs as well as access the Cosmos ecosystem via Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).\\\\n\\\\nAs a first step, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022.

Build A Community Owned DEX (UniV3)\n## Authors\n- [Orbital Apes](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes)\n\n- [Evmos DAO](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\n\n## Summary\nThe Evmos DAO and Orbital Apes team aim to deliver a fully community owned DEX within two months. We believe that Evmos can become market competitive in terms of liquidity and user experience. \n\n- No investment token \n- No initial swap fees \n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset and continous development guaranteed\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will ship a V3 DEX deployment in the shortest amount of time. The OA team will handle the engineering side, while the responsibilities of socials management, proposals for incentives and incentives management would be handled by the EvmosDAO.\n\nThe requested funds is for the Orbital Apes team only since the Evmos DAO is already fully funded. Funding is requested as this DEX will be built as public good for Evmos and will not have any funding coming from token sales or protocol fees.\n\n*Notes: This can be seen as an alternative to the ICHI proposal. We believe that we can ship a more feature rich DEX at **much lower costs**. To our knowledge, UniV3 is not adding new chains any time soon due to legal reasons.*\n\n## Goal\nCreate a capital efficient AMM to grow native liquidity on Evmos. This will be achieved with the help of EvmosDAO by creating cross-chain proposals for co-incentives (Evmos and Partnering chain) to LP providers and cross-chain token swaps to create protocol-owned liquidity managed by EvmosDAO.\n\n## Deployment Path of UniV3 Fork\n\n1. Engineer custom V3 DEX frontend with IBC<>ERC20 conversion\n2. Fork UniV3 and deploy modified contracts (no protocol fees, no investement token) in April\n3. Bridge integration  \n4. Keplr integration (third party dependency)\n\n### Benefits  \n**1 - Liquidity**\nThe Evmos DAO team will be making proposals on other IBC chains to incentivize this DEX along with supplemented Evmos incentives.Protocol owned liquidty would work along side this as well. This will allow Evmos to build more native liquidity and force wider users to IBC tokens into Evmos. After this more DeFi protocols can be built once on chain liquidity is established.\n\n**2 - Time to market**\nWe are market ready within two months. Targetting testnet before April and mainnet once the UniV3 license expires. \n*Side note: The whole cosmos ecosystem is moving towards LSD's. V3 positions are much more tuned for these pools then traditional Dex's. V3 is may more profitable for LP's and provides a much stronger peg between something like stAtom/Atom. If we wait 5 months instead of 2 months we could potentially lose a large chunk of this liquidity to other protocols.*\n\n**3 - Keplr integration**\nIn the near future Keplr is going to have full EVM compatibiltiy. The users will be able to interact with Keplr and Metamask on the DEX.\n\n- [ERC20 Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/531)\n- [Tx Signing Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/483)\n- Contracts signing: Once contracts signing is integrated by Keplr the OA will merge it into the DEX.\n\n**4 - IBC conversion page**\nSimilar to https://app.evmos.org/assets, this will provide a user friendly interface and reduce complexity of onboarding cosmos based users. A bridge section will be added to deposit/withdraw from multiple EVM chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and many more through Satellite (Axelar). \n\n**5 - No Protocol Fees** \nTraditional decentralized exchanges charge a fee on every swap that flows directly to the protocol or token holders. Initially this will be set to zero, any changes of the fee structure must be approved by the Evmos governance in form of a text proposal. LP fees will still be charged and distributed on swaps to LP providers.\n\n**6 - No Investment Token**\nThe community owned DEX will not have a corresponding governance token. As a community owned project built by OA/EvmosDAO future major developments will be funded through seperate funding requests or grants programs/boutnies. Incentives for liquidity will come in the form of Evmos incentives proposals and Cross-Chain incentives proposals.\n\n\n**7 - Future Development: All the upcoming Evmos/Cross-Chain innovation**\n- New innovation like ICA and ICQ will be actively explored and integrated the best possible way to stay competitive. Such integration would require a seperate funding request.\n- Explore and integrate cross-chain bridge swaps through services such as LiFi.\n\n\n\n\n## Milestones\n|Nr.|Milestone    | Release of Funds  | \n|---|---|---|\n|1. | Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Testnet|40% two weeks after testnet | \n|2. | Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Mainnet|40% two weeks after mainnet |  \n|3. | IBC conversion page integration                  |10% after functional integration|  \n|4. | Keplr integration                         |10% after functional integration|  \n\n\n## Funding Amount\nThis funding proposal will kick off the development for V3.

everyone, I’m Jessica aka web3_analyst and am a data engineer and IBC lead for Flipside Governance, an arm of Flipside. I am seeking feedback on the following proposal idea:\n\nBackground:\n\nOver the past week, 7 governance proposals have been submitted for on-chain voting. Only two of which are legitimate. A typical week sees one or two proposals submitted on-chain, so while not yet drastic this action signals a change in typical activity.\n\n(image)\n\nUnfortunately, the five spam proposals are malicious in nature and aim at getting users to click on a link containing malware. It should be considered unsafe for users to interact with these proposals in any way, including interacting with links and submitting deposits.  A worse scenario would be if any of these proposals made it to vote, where governance participants may be tricked into thinking one of these proposals is legitimate.\n\nLooking at the Cosmos Hub, we can see how this issue can get worse. The following discussion was posted on the Cosmos Hub forums on 23 February 2023. Over the seven days preceding this discussion, 115 proposals had been submitted on-chain. Two addresses were responsible for a majority of the spam, submitting 106 proposals in total.\n\nEvmos is a growing blockchain, and as more users are on-boarded it is reasonable to expect that the instances of spam will increase as well.\n\nImplementing a Minimum Initial Deposit (MID)\n\nTo reduce the number of potentially harmful proposals being submitted on-chain, we propose adding a minimum initial deposit that is required when submitting a proposal.\n\nFor Discussion: Minimum Initial Deposit Amount\n\nAs a starting place for discussion, we propose 900 Evmos as a minimum required initial deposit. This represents 1/4th of the total required deposit for a proposal to go to vote, which is the standard on IBC blockchains such as Osmosis that already have a Minimum Initial Deposit.\n\n(image)\n\nOver the past 3 months, the price of Evmos has remained somewhat consistent. An initial required deposit of 900 EVmos would typically be in the $350-$500 dollar price range in current market conditions.  We believe that this amount would be significant enough to deter the submission of spam proposals, while still minimal enough to not prevent community involvement in the governance process.\n\nNext Steps\n\nFollowing a period of feedback, should the community be in favor of implementing a Minimum Initial Deposit, we can move forward with a governance vote.\n\nAbout Us\n\nFlipside Governance is the governance arm of Flipside Crypto, a community-enabled data analytics platform. Our governance team contributes to DAOs full-time, providing research, voting & proposal development, and data-driven decision-making. Flipside Governance is active in Cosmos, Osmosis, Evmos, Juno, and Axelar within IBCs and is also involved with AAVE, MakerDAO, Optimism, Safe, and Hop.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1177,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":6,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-03-01T18:34:40.749Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos137drs6cwufy5q6k3vzrmpsdv6kga0l3t5h5unv\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"web3_analyst\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"Data engineer and governance contributor at Flipside Crypto.\\\\n\\\\nTwitter: @web3_analyst Discord: web3_analyst#8101 Telegram: @jkh1023\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/3acf489a-c75b-4406-9bf7-db18896b08a6.jpg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-03-01T15:36:42.811Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Hi everyone, I’m Jessica aka web3_analyst and am a data engineer and IBC lead for Flipside Governance, an arm of Flipside.

Evmos Core team wants to start a discussion around a possible adjust to the current EVMOS token inflation schedule through changing the Decay Factor in a way that preserves the initial 4 year distribution target of 1 Billion EVMOS tokens. Considering the current macro environment, the current token inflation schedule may need to be adjusted in order to preserve the long term success of the Evmos ecosystem. The Evmos Core team has provided information below that is meant to serve as reference points for the community to provide input and guidance on any final adjustment decisions.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Evmos token model is designed to distribute a total of 1 Billion tokens after 4 years, with high inflation in the early stages aimed at bootstrapping the ecosystem in a competitive environment. Recent events have altered the macro environment, and reasonably calls for a review to make sure we align with current times. One way to remain flexible during these times without making any substantial changes to the token model would be to take some of the initially planned inflation in the earlier stages and spread them out in a more responsible way that still meets the same 4 year supply target of 1 Billion tokens.\n\nThe inflation distribution for staking, usage incentives and community pool is implemented through an exponential formula, a.k.a. the Half Life.\n\nInflation is minted in daily epochs. During a period of 365 epochs (one year), a daily provision ( epochProvison ) of Evmos tokens is minted and allocated to staking rewards, usage incentives and the community pool. The epoch provision depends on module parameters and is recalculated at the end of every epoch.\n\nThe calculation of the epoch provision is done according to the following formula:\n\nperiodProvision = exponentialDecay * bondingIncentive\n\nf(x) = (a * (1 - r) ^ x + c) * (1 + maxVariance * (1 - bondedRatio / bondingTarget))\n\nepochProvision = periodProvision / epochsPerPeriod\n\nwhere (with default values):\n\nx = variable = year\n\na = 300,000,000 = initial value\n\nr = 0.5 = decay factor\n\nc = 9,375,000 = long term supply\n\nbondedRatio = variable = fraction of the staking tokens which are currently bonded\n\nmaxVariance = 0.0 = the max amount to increase inflation\n\nbondingTarget = 0.66 = our optimal bonded ratio\n\nPossible Changes to the Decay Factor:\n\nBelow are tables with the Half Life formula that show examples of possible changes to staking APR, total inflation, and daily minted EVMOS tokens and serve as a reference points for discussion. These changes can be made all at once, or spread out over a period of time to limit any possible side effects.\n\nPlease note, the Year 1 Epoch table in the top right will be inaccurate as days go by but do not effect any information provided.\n\nScenario 1: A change from .5 to .3596828656 to the decay function:\n\n-Inflation change: 79.92% to 48.5%\n\n-Staking APR Change: 122.11% to 91.72%\n\n(image)\n\nScenario 2: A change from .5 to .15911367446 to the decay function:\n\n-Inflation change: 79.92% to 35.38%\n\n-Staking APR Change: 122.11% to 62.91%\n\n(image)\n\nNo Change:\n\n(image)\n\n*Note: The 100k difference in tokens is the testnet rewards that aren't included in these numbers .\n\nPoints for Discussion:\n\nIs a proactive approach to adjusting inflation a path that token holders are in favor of?\n\nUsing the provided reference points for possible changes to the decay function, what is a responsible target to aim for of changes are to be made?\n\nIf adjustments are made, would spreading out the total change help the network limit any unseen side effects?\n\nWith previous LP incentive initiatives ending and the upcoming halvening, what effect will that have on current token holder behavior?\n\nWill this lead to any unforeseen effects that need to be taken into account?\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nThis will make NO  change to the total supply, nor the targeted amount of 1 Billion EVMOS tokens after 4 years. These changes also take into account the upcoming halvening at Year 2 and is reflected accordingly into the tables. Any changes to the decay factor would not adjust the distribution proportions, but only the total amount being distributed during each epoch.

The Evmos Core team has provided information below that is meant to serve as reference points for the community to provide input and guidance on any final adjustment decisions. \\\\n\\\\nAbstract\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe Evmos token model is designed to distribute a total of 1 Billion tokens after 4 years, with high inflation in the early stages aimed at bootstrapping the ecosystem in a competitive environment. Recent events have caused the Macro environment to take a complete turn, and reasonably calls for some consideration into how/if any changes need to be made in order to better reflect the current times. One way to remain flexible during these times without making any substantial changes to the token model would be to take some of the initially planned inflation in the earlier stages and spread them out in a more responsible way that still meets the same 4 year supply target of 1 Billion tokens.\\\\n\\\\nThe inflation distribution for staking, usage incentives and community pool is implemented through an exponential formula, a.k.a. the Half Life.\\\\n\\\\nInflation is minted in daily epochs. During a period of 365 epochs (one year), a daily provision (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"epochProvison\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\") of Evmos tokens is minted and allocated to staking rewards, usage incentives and the community pool.

proposal would raise the minimum amount of EVMOS tokens to be deposited for a proposal to reach on-chain voting from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS with the intentions to maintain high quality proposals and prevent spam from going on chain.\n\nAbstract\n\nProposal Deposit Concept:\n\nFor governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the min_deposit  param in the governance module before the deposit end time.\n\nA proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.\n\nThe proposer account is only required to deposit ~1 EVMOS .\n\nDeposit Refund and Burn Concept:\n\nIf the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.\n\nIf the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.\n\nMotivation\n\nProposal to Increase Deposit Amount:\n\nBy the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit requires 192 EVMOS  or approximately 60  in USD  equivalent. Currently, is a low threshold to help ensure quality proposals and prevent possible spam proposals. Comparing other cosmos governance current deposits, the Cosmos hub requires 250 ATOM or 2,280 USD and Osmosis requires 1600 OSMO or 1,193 USD for proposals to enter the on-chain voting stage.\n\nWith the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to 3500 EVMOS  or approximately 1,100  in USD  equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nCommunity Members must not  be priced out of making proposals on chain. 3500 EVMOS  is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, whilst still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves.\n\nMultiple wallets may fund any proposal deposit, so this remains within the realm of most Cosmos users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, where a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking.\n\nVoting:\n\nBy voting YES , you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS.\n\nBy voting NO , you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN , you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\nBy voting NOWITHVETO , you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 192 EVMOS, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1177,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":3,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-27T18:44:58.940Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos14rsst0wnenhpxqv0drtvmz5jegp2dtcpf0srcl\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Tricky\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-22T01:12:04.490Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Summary\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis

Varadinov ( @vladfortech ), Evmos Core Teams\n\nParameters being changed with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 95% . The remainder 5% is to prevent spam.\n\nThe current module parameters can be queried as follows:\n\n➜ evmosd q revenue params --node=https://tendermint.bd.evmos.org:26657 addr_derivation_cost_create: \"50\" developer_shares: \"0.500000000000000000\" enable_revenue: true\n\nMotivation\n\nThe x/revenue module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the Evmos Token Model  , this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The developer_shares parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.\n\nConsidering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 95% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.\n\nWe acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.\n\nIf this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the commission on staking rewards and 95% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.\n\nImpact\n\nRegistered smart contracts will receive 95% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.\n\nBelow are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:\n\nAt current Evmos price ($0.40637) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.00466466 * 200000 txs * 0.95 = $886.29\n\nAt Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.01669652 * 100000 txs * 0.95 = $1,586.17\n\nAt optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.03756717 * 50000 txs * 0.95 = $1,784.43\n\nGas price calculations were generated with this calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBefore voting, please read through this proposal and the current comments.

Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees.

thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place. Community members have expressed concerns over this, and have proposed moving back the decay date to a later date and to reimburse the decayed tokens.\n\nPLAN OF ACTION\n\nWe delay the start of the Rektdrop decay to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022.\n\nSignal commitment to reimburse anyone who experienced decay on their airdrop before the newly set date of Monday August 1st, 2022 . These tokens will be reimbursed from the community pool at a later date after all the data is gathered and verified.\n\nWe fast track this proposal on chain if there are no concerns or red flags from the community to limit the amount of decay users experience and make step 2 simpler.\n\nThis will not only ensure users don't experience decay at no fault of their own, but also give more time for new users to claim this airdrop to promote healthy token distribution for Evmos.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe push back the Rektdropt decay date to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022 @ approximately 09:00 UTC. We signal agreement that any user who experienced decay before the newly set decay date should have those tokens reimbursed by the community pool at a later time after we gather the proper info and come up with the plan to send these funds back.\n\nConsidering the start of decay being less than the socially agreed 3 days for a commonwealth discussion, we may fast track this proposal on chain to limit the decay for users if there is no opposition from community members.\n\nI will update the thread with relevant information and decisions as the discussion matures and it is needed.

inspiration from another post from the community, This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition for the voting options “Yes”, “No”, “Abstain”, and “NoWithVeto” in Evmos governance that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community. These definitions are taken directly from the Evmos docs, and will be further formalized with this vote.\n\nAbstain : indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n\nYes : indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNo : indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNoWithVeto : indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No . If the number of NoWithVeto  votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain  votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned .\n\nAn additional point of discussion is if a proposal to nullify and void any proposal that attempted to add implied meanings to “NO”, “ABSTAIN”, or “NO WITH VETO” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal. A clarifying proposal that states the actual meaning of NO for past proposals is also another route that can be explored.\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecently, there have been proposals that have attempted to redefine the meanings of the voting options in a governance process. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters, which can in turn undermine the will of the voters. To ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the views of the community, it is crucial to clearly define the meanings of the voting options and design the governance process in a way that promotes fairness and effectiveness.\n\nFor example, in Evmos governance a \"no\" vote is generally understood to mean that the voter is opposed to the proposal and does not want it to be implemented. An \"abstain\" vote means that the voter is neutral on the proposal and does not wish to express a position either for or against it. A \"no with veto\" vote means the voter is strongly opposed and in most cases will lead to the proposal deposit being burned.\n\nIt can be dangerous to add or change meanings to the voting options in a governance process because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters. Additionally, adding implied meanings to the voting options can undermine the transparency and fairness of the governance process. If voters do not understand the full implications of their votes, they may make decisions that are not in line with their true views or the best interests of the community. This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community.\n\nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community.\n\nThis proposal aims to set the following meanings that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community:\n\nAbstain : indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n\nYes : indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNo : indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNoWithVeto : indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No . If the number of NoWithVeto  votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain  votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned .\n\nAn additional point of discussion is if a proposal to nullify and void any proposal that attempted to change the meanings of “No”, “Abstain”, or “NoWithVeto” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal.

This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal aims to set the following meanings that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstain\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Yes\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"No\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"NoWithVeto\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://docs.evmos.org/users/governance/process.html#burned-deposits\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"burned\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA point for discussion is if a proposal that also nullify and voids any proposal that attempted to add implied meanings to “NO”, “ABSTAIN”, or “NO WITH VETO” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal. A clarifying proposal that states the actual meaning of NO for past proposals is also another route that can be explored.\\\\n\\\\nOpen to any and all feedback and welcome discussion from the community.\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"links":null,"has_poll":null,"canvas_action":null,"canvas_session":null,"canvas_hash":null,"created_at":"2023-01-06T03:28:19.720Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T00:51:48.924Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-01-08T12:16:52.163Z","Address":{"id":47245,"address":"evmos14rsst0wnenhpxqv0drtvmz5jegp2dtcpf0srcl","chain":"evmos","verified":"2023-04-06T17:57:42.331Z","keytype":null,"name":"Tricky | Evmos","last_active":"2023-04-20T16:52:44.684Z","user_id":43332,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":40615,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":43332},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1357,"name":"7.

starting this discussion to address what I believe to be a serious and willful governance attack on the Evmos chain. While I will make recommendations in this discussion that I hope will result in future governance proposals, this discussion isn't intended to go on chain itself.\n\nOver the past few days, contributors to the Laurel Project (https://twitter.com/provable_laurel) have put a number of what I consider to be malicious proposals on chain. These proposals are:\n\nProposal 95\n\nProposal 98\n\nProposal 99\n\nThey have also submitted additional proposals in the past several weeks that may or may not fall under the category of malicious, but it's these three proposals in particular that I wish to focus on for the reasons set forth below. Note that in many of these proposals, the Laurel Project attempts to paint the \"No\" vote option as meaning something other than \"The Evmos chain governance rejects this proposal.\"\n\nThe discussion will center around the Laurel Project's documented threat to sue the Evmos DAO and Evmos core contributors, because I believe this to be the reason that these proposals are now on chain and were proposed on advice of counsel (explained in more detail below). For background on the Laurel Project's threat to sue, please see https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md . Screenshots below in case this link is ever deleted:\n\n(image)\n\nI reference this as a background so that we can look at these latest proposals through a lens of what someone who is preparing for litigation might do to increase their odds of success. One of the best sources of evidence in litigation is an opposing party's documented admissions. By crafting the language around a \"NO\" vote or a non-passage outcome carefully, the Laurel project is attempting to force Evmos governance to make admissions / statements that they can later use in court (as voting options are limited and lack nuance). Now, let's dive into the proposals themselves with this in mind:\n\nProposal 95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)\n\nThis proposal lays the groundwork (albeit VERY poorly) for a potential cause of action against Evmos. I don't believe this would be successful, but it's still important to note that this proposal's \"NO\" vote option includes the following language:\n\nThe legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort.\n\nI'm not sure they understand what \"volunteer\" means, but at any rate, were this to be deemed as an admission of Evmos governance, it could potentially be problematic as an admission that money is owed here.\n\nAlso worth noting that both of the validators controlled by the Laurel Project, Evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers voted \"NO\" on this proposal.\n\nProposal 98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain\n\nThis proposal seeks, on its face, to have a system of elected officers that represent the chain in an official capacity. Why is this important from a legal perspective? One of the most difficult things about suing a decentralized project is finding an appropriate representative party to sue / serve with process. In a traditional corporation / LLC, this would be one of the corp's owners / officers.\n\nIt appears that the Laurel Project is painfully aware of this, as the text of this proposal indicates that clarifying a party to represent the chain in a legal capacity is one of the proposal's goals:\n\nNon-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:\n\nprovide transparency of:\n\n- power structure\n\n- actions done for the benefit of the chain\n\n- provide evidence of decentralization\n\n- clarify the assignment of responsibility\n\n- welcome cooperation with other chains\n\n- obtain delegation of representation\n\n- expand the types of actions the chain can govern\n\n- legitimize legal representation\n\n- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)\n\nImportantly, it doesn't really matter whether this proposal passes or not. If the proposal passes, the Laurel project may attempt use this vote as evidence that the chain has authorized certain individuals to represent it in a legal capacity (and can therefore be sued / served in a representative capacity). It also helps establish jurisdiction as a location where these individuals are located.\n\nIf the proposal doesn't pass, the language \"the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody\" is concerning, as they may attempt to use this as an admission that any DAO member (token holder) may be sued in a representative capacity for the entirety of the chain and Evmos token holders.\n\nProposal 99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions\n\nThis one seems mostly inflammatory / directed at drawing regulatory or criminal investigation. It sounds as though a \"NO\" vote here will be used to press criminal charges against the chain for something related to the alleged nonpayment for the Laurel Project's volunteer services.\n\nif this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law\n\nThe terms of art used here indicate to me that they've sought legal counsel around putting up this proposal (\"premeditation\" specifically speaks to an intent element required for many criminal causes of action).\n\nPotential Mitigation Steps and Punitive Measures\n\nRegardless of whether these efforts will be successful or not, I firmly believe that the governance actions taken by the Laurel project in the last few weeks constitute a deliberate and malicious attack on the chain and a manipulation of the governance process for the personal gain of the Laurel Project and its contributors. If Evmos governance is of the same mind, there are a few measures we can take to mitigate any potential damage of and / or punish the Laurel Project for these actions.\n\nMeasure 1: Ratify governance-official meanings for Yes, No, and NoWithVeto\n\nThis is a mitigation step to prevent abuses like this from happening in the future. At minimum, Yes, and No should have meanings defined by governance that supersede what is mentioned in any other proposal. To be safe, this should also be made retroactive to clarify what was meant by votes that the DAO has already made.\n\nWhat these definitions are should be subject to healthy community discussion in a separate thread.\n\nMeasure 2: Vote to tombstone the Evmos4volunteers and Votes4volunteers validators\n\nAdmittedly, this punitive measure is a bit extreme and should be considered very carefully before being implemented. These two validators are under the control of the Laurel Project and / or Laurel Project contributors. The continued control of significant voting power in the hands of actors that are deemed malicious represents a threat to the short and long-term health of the chain.\n\nI'm not wholly familiar with the tech intricacies of what might be required to implement this, but I think this could be done via a software upgrade that sets the status of these validators to tombstoned. Ideally this could be done without slashing the delegators but again, this is something that should be discussed in a separate thread.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the governance actions of the Laurel Project have (appropriately) been mostly the subject to ridicule and anger, I believe the broader Evmos community doesn't recognize the potential threat that these actions represent to the chain and the governance process. This post is intended to start a serious conversation around this subject, whether my recommendations are implemented or not.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1357,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":8,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-01-05T23:37:21.880Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1cd80nuy940v4epql0vn2tjc3qmd2vz3y6prjwz\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"RoboMcGobo\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-01-05T21:18:04.268Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"I'm starting this discussion to address what I believe to be a serious and willful governance attack on the Evmos chain.

Now, let's dive into the proposals themselves with this in mind: \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal lays the groundwork (albeit VERY poorly) for a potential cause of action against Evmos. I don't believe this would be successful, but it's still important to note that this proposal's \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" vote option includes the following language: \\\\n\\\\nThe legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nI'm not sure they understand what \\\\\\\"volunteer\\\\\\\" means, but at any rate, were this to be deemed as an admission of Evmos governance, it could potentially be problematic as an admission that money is owed here.\\\\n\\\\nAlso worth noting that both of the validators controlled by the Laurel Project, Evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers voted \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal seeks, on its face, to have a system of elected officers that represent the chain in an official capacity. Why is this important from a legal perspective? One of the most difficult things about suing a decentralized project is finding an appropriate representative party to sue / serve with process. In a traditional corporation / LLC, this would be one of the corp's owners / officers.\\\\n\\\\nIt appears that the Laurel Project is painfully aware of this, as the text of this proposal indicates that clarifying a party to represent the chain in a legal capacity is one of the proposal's goals: \\\\n\\\\nNon-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"provide transparency of:\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- power structure\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- actions done for the benefit of the chain\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- provide evidence of decentralization\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- clarify the assignment of responsibility\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- welcome cooperation with other chains\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- obtain delegation of representation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- expand the types of actions the chain can govern\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- legitimize legal representation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nImportantly, it doesn't really matter whether this proposal passes or not. If the proposal passes, the Laurel project may attempt use this vote as evidence that the chain has authorized certain individuals to represent it in a legal capacity (and can therefore be sued / served in a representative capacity). It also helps establish jurisdiction as a location where these individuals are located.\\\\n\\\\nIf the proposal doesn't pass, the language \\\\\\\"the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody\\\\\\\" is concerning, as they may attempt to use this as an admission that any DAO member (token holder) may be sued in a representative capacity for the entirety of the chain and Evmos token holders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis one seems mostly inflammatory / directed at drawing regulatory or criminal investigation. It sounds as though a \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" vote here will be used to press criminal charges against the chain for something related to the alleged nonpayment for the Laurel Project's volunteer services.\\\\n\\\\nif this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe terms of art used here indicate to me that they've sought legal counsel around putting up this proposal (\\\\\\\"premeditation\\\\\\\" specifically speaks to an intent element required for many criminal causes of action).\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Potential Mitigation Steps and Punitive Measures\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of whether these efforts will be successful or not, I firmly believe that the governance actions taken by the Laurel project in the last few weeks constitute a deliberate and malicious attack on the chain and a manipulation of the governance process for the personal gain of the Laurel Project and its contributors. If Evmos governance is of the same mind, there are a few measures we can take to mitigate any potential damage of and / or punish the Laurel Project for these actions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Measure 1: Ratify governance-official meanings for Yes, No, and NoWithVeto\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis is a mitigation step to prevent abuses like this from happening in the future. At minimum, Yes, and No should have meanings defined by governance that supersede what is mentioned in any other proposal. To be safe, this should also be made retroactive to clarify what was meant by votes that the DAO has already made.\\\\n\\\\nWhat these definitions are should be subject to healthy community discussion in a separate thread.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Measure 2: Vote to tombstone the Evmos4volunteers and Votes4volunteers validators\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAdmittedly, this punitive measure is a bit extreme and should be considered very carefully before being implemented. These two validators are under the control of the Laurel Project and / or Laurel Project contributors. The continued control of significant voting power in the hands of actors that are deemed malicious represents a threat to the short and long-term health of the chain.\\\\n\\\\nI'm not wholly familiar with the tech intricacies of what might be required to implement this, but I \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"think\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" this could be done via a software upgrade that sets the status of these validators to tombstoned. Ideally this could be done without slashing the delegators but again, this is something that should be discussed in a separate thread.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Conclusion\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWhile the governance actions of the Laurel Project have (appropriately) been mostly the subject to ridicule and anger, I believe the broader Evmos community doesn't recognize the potential threat that these actions represent to the chain and the governance process. This post is intended to start a serious conversation around this subject, whether my recommendations are implemented or not. \\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"links":null,"has_poll":null,"canvas_action":null,"canvas_session":null,"canvas_hash":null,"created_at":"2023-01-05T23:37:21.902Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T14:05:24.810Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-01-06T03:09:15.812Z","Address":{"id":89679,"address":"evmos1cd80nuy940v4epql0vn2tjc3qmd2vz3y6prjwz","chain":"evmos","verified":null,"keytype":null,"name":"RoboMcGobo","last_active":"2023-01-06T03:09:36.453Z","user_id":null,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":null,"wallet_id":"keplr-ethereum","UserId":null},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1357,"name":"7.

I guess a lot of us already heard about GPT-3 chat, but for those who don't, that's an open AI chat platform. Very helpful to summarize some complex information in a readable form for the normal human being.\n\nI thought this would be interesting to share the recent chat I had with the AI on cryptos in general and then narrowing the scope to DAOs and their structuring. This was a hot topic there recently, so maybe having AI insight on the matter may help people to grasp what's a stake.\n\n[I skiped the initial part of the talk, where I gave the AI a context on crypto before moving to DAOs]\n\nME : any thoughts on DAOs ?\n\nGPT : Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are digital organizations that are governed by a set of rules encoded into smart contracts and run on a blockchain. They are designed to be decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity, but are instead governed by the consensus of their members.\n\nDAOs have gained a lot of attention in recent years because of their potential to enable more transparent, efficient, and democratic forms of governance and decision-making. They have the potential to disrupt traditional organizational models and to create new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that DAOs are still a relatively new and untested concept, and there are many challenges and risks associated with their use. For example, DAOs are vulnerable to code vulnerabilities and attacks, and there have been instances where DAOs have been exploited or hacked. Additionally, there are questions about the legal status and accountability of DAOs, and it is not yet clear how they will be treated by regulators and the legal system.\n\nOverall, DAOs are an interesting and promising concept, but they are also still in the early stages of development and adoption, and it is difficult to say for certain what the future holds for them.\n\nME : what could be the attack vectors against DAOs ?\n\nGPT : There are several potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):\n\nSmart contract vulnerabilities: Like any smart contract, a DAO's code is vulnerable to bugs and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. For example, if a DAO's code contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal funds, the attacker could exploit that vulnerability to drain the DAO's funds.\n\nSybil attacks: In a Sybil attack, an attacker creates multiple fake identities and uses them to gain a disproportionate amount of influence within a DAO. This could allow the attacker to sway voting outcomes or to gain control of the DAO.\n\nMajority attack: If an attacker is able to gain control of a majority of the voting power within a DAO, they could use that power to manipulate voting outcomes and to control the DAO's decisions.\n\nFrontrunning: In a frontrunning attack, an attacker monitors the blockchain for pending transactions and then executes their own transactions that depend on the outcome of those pending transactions before they are processed. This could allow the attacker to profit from the pending transactions or to disrupt the operation of the DAO.\n\nPhishing attacks: Like any online organization, a DAO is vulnerable to phishing attacks in which attackers use fake websites or emails to trick users into revealing their login credentials or private keys.\n\nThere are other potential attack vectors as well, and it is important for DAO developers and users to be aware of the risks and to take appropriate measures to protect themselves.\n\nME : what would be the best way to structure DAOs ?\n\nGPT : There is no one \"best\" way to structure a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), as the optimal structure will depend on the specific goals and needs of the DAO. That being said, there are a few key considerations that can be helpful when designing the structure of a DAO:\n\nDecentralization: A key feature of DAOs is that they are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity. It is important for the structure of a DAO to reflect this decentralization, for example by using a distributed governance model or by using a blockchain-based voting system.\n\nTransparency: DAOs should be designed to be transparent, so that all members have access to relevant information and can see how decisions are being made.\n\nRobustness: The structure of a DAO should be designed to be robust and resistant to attacks or disruptions. This may involve using multiple layers of security or implementing measures to mitigate the risks of vulnerabilities or Sybil attacks.\n\nFlexibility: A DAO's structure should be flexible enough to allow it to adapt to changing needs or circumstances. This may involve using a modular design or implementing a system for on-chain governance.\n\nThere are many other factors that can also be important when designing the structure of a DAO, and it is important for DAO developers to carefully consider their specific goals and needs when designing the structure of their DAO.\n\nME : how could we improve the decentralization ?\n\nGPT : There are a number of ways in which the decentralization of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be improved:\n\nDistributed governance: A distributed governance model, in which decisions are made by a diverse group of stakeholders rather than by a single individual or entity, can help to increase the decentralization of a DAO.\n\nBlockchain-based voting: Using a blockchain-based voting system, such as a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, can help to ensure that voting is transparent, secure, and resistant to tampering.\n\nUse of multiple blockchain platforms: Using multiple blockchain platforms can help to increase the decentralization of a DAO by reducing the risk of a single point of failure.\n\nDecentralized infrastructure: Using decentralized infrastructure, such as decentralized file storage or decentralized DNS, can help to increase the overall decentralization of a DAO.\n\nDiversity of stakeholders: Ensuring that the stakeholders of a DAO are diverse and come from different backgrounds and locations can help to increase the decentralization of the DAO.\n\nIt is important to note that achieving a high degree of decentralization can be challenging, and it may involve trade-offs with other considerations such as scalability and efficiency.\n\nME : should cosmos blockchains run with DAOs ?\n\nGPT : Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can be built on top of the Cosmos platform, and it is possible for Cosmos-based blockchains to incorporate DAO functionality into their design. However, it is not necessary for all Cosmos-based blockchains to use DAOs, and the decision to use a DAO will depend on the specific goals and needs of the blockchain.\n\nDAOs have the potential to provide a transparent, efficient, and democratic form of governance and decision-making, and they can be useful for a wide range of applications. However, they also have their own set of risks and challenges, and it is important for blockchain developers to carefully consider whether a DAO is the right choice for their particular use case.\n\nIn general, the decision to use a DAO or not will depend on the specific needs and goals of the blockchain, as well as the trade-offs that the developers are willing to make in terms of decentralization, security, scalability, and other factors.\n\nME : what kind of trade-offs ?\n\nGPT : There are a number of trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to use a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on a blockchain:\n\nDecentralization vs. efficiency: One trade-off to consider is the balance between decentralization and efficiency. DAOs can provide a decentralized and transparent form of governance, but they may also be slower and less efficient than more centralized alternatives.\n\nSecurity vs. complexity: Another trade-off to consider is the balance between security and complexity. DAOs can be more secure than centralized alternatives, but they can also be more complex to design and manage.\n\nFlexibility vs. stability: DAOs can be designed to be highly flexible, but this can also make them less stable. On the other hand, more rigid structures may be more stable, but less flexible.\n\nLegal and regulatory uncertainty: There is still a lot of uncertainty around the legal and regulatory status of DAOs, which can be a risk for organizations that decide to use them.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the trade-offs that may be involved in the decision to use a DAO, and it is important for organizations to carefully consider their specific goals and needs when deciding whether a DAO is the right choice for them.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf there's something to take away from this, that would be that very last question I asked. We have offered a system here, it's been rejected and we have learned our lesson on that front. There have been some wild critics, some justified, most of them not. We just encourage others to take on our lead and help craft a true DAO system for this chain. This chat with GPT sets the baseline of reflection needed to go ahead.

They have the potential to disrupt traditional organizational models and to create new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.\\\\nHowever, it is important to note that DAOs are still a relatively new and untested concept, and there are many challenges and risks associated with their use. For example, DAOs are vulnerable to code vulnerabilities and attacks, and there have been instances where DAOs have been exploited or hacked. Additionally, there are questions about the legal status and accountability of DAOs, and it is not yet clear how they will be treated by regulators and the legal system.\\\\nOverall, DAOs are an interesting and promising concept, but they are also still in the early stages of development and adoption, and it is difficult to say for certain what the future holds for them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"ME : \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"what could be the attack vectors against DAOs ?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"GPT : \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"There are several potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):\\\\nSmart contract vulnerabilities: Like any smart contract, a DAO's code is vulnerable to bugs and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

we approach the one-year mark since inception of the Usage Incentive Fund, it is high time we take a closer look at its untapped potential. Currently, the fund has amassed 96 million EVMOS tokens, with a total of 200 million slated for distribution within the forthcoming 3 years. It arguably is a crucial component for driving user growth and network expansion.\n\nThis ideation/brainstorming aims to explore creative and effective ways to jumpstart the fund, focusing on liquidity mining and other strategies that will maximize its impact on the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\nContext:\n\nThe initial vision of the ‘usage incentives’ was laid out in the Evmos Token Model . The two mentioned main components were gas rebates and liquidity mining.\n\nConsidering the near-zero gas fees that are already in place, further reductions would likely have minimal influence on network growth. This rather opens up the possibility of unnecessary network spam of (near) zero-value transactions.\n\nOn the other hand, liquidity mining and other potentially more complex DeFi usage incentives can arguably make the Evmos ecosystem significantly more appealing to both users and developers.\n\nTo quote from the Evmos token model blog:\n\n“The idea would be to allocate Evmos tokens from the usage incentives pool to a contract where you would lock up your DEX LP positions, money market IOUs or other liquidity IOUs. (i.e. a UNIv2 LP position, an AAVE aToken/Compound cToken or Connext liquidity.) [...] The contract will be governance controlled so that token holders can decide what applications on the Evmos chain would be eligible for usage incentives farming.\n\nThis effectively is a liquidity mining program that is linked to the base layer, but governance controlled. (think decentralized Avalanche Rush)”\n\nTo me personally, the idea of a decentralized Avalanche Rush was extremely compelling. Of course, the management of such a program is not a simple endeavor, but I believe that efforts in this regard would be resources very well spent.\n\nThus far, the community pool served for a few liquidity incentive programs. However, compared to staking incentives these have been comparatively small-scale.\n\nThe following graphic better illustrates the situation at hand:\n\n(image)\n\nI believe this huge disparity in incentive allocations is one of the main drivers of the “stake and chill” vibe that has dominated Evmos since its inception. There are simply not enough incentives for the majority of the user base to migrate their staked tokens into DeFi applications.\n\nIn theory, LSTs can help surpass the base staking yield for EVMOS in DeFi applications. However, there still should be incentives that make DeFi more compelling because LSTs can only aid in counterbalancing the minimal risk-free staking yield.\n\nFor example, stEVMOS from Stride has been available for a while, but it has not yet significantly contributed to a more vibrant Evmos ecosystem. I’m hopeful that we’ll see steps in the right direction soon with incentives for Forge, which utilizes LSTs. But small-scale LM programs funded by the community pool are not comparable to the potential that the usage incentive fund could unleash.\n\nAnd it’s not necessarily only users that are attracted by a proper use of the usage incentive fund. Builders are also indirectly incentivized to build applications that governance may decide to incentivize with EVMOS, which in turn increases usage and generated fees for protocols built on Evmos.\n\nSo, the question emerges: how can we best utilize this fund to create a more vibrant Evmos Ecosystem?\n\nA very simple approach would be to turn the ‘incentive fund’ into a ‘community pool’ structure, only with a different purpose.\n\nA more complex endeavor would be to transform it into some sort of Curve-like system that distributes incentives to certain reward gauges based on voting shares received. With standard Cosmos governance (yes, no, abstain) that isn’t feasible of course, but maybe this can be done once stateful precompiled smart contracts are live? Could those access the Cosmos vote module or a special type of vote module that interacts with the usage incentive fund? If possible, that would also be a powerful demonstration of Cosmos<->EVM module synergies.\n\nI’m sure there are many other potential solutions and I’m eager to hear any input!","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":"","topic_id":952,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":233,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-04-29T15:31:12.203Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_address\\\":\\\"evmos10kvt4wu9enmg4sm7emwzapmcvg030pnl7hhh2x\\\",\\\"_chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Nick\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":null,\\\"_id\\\":42584,\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-04-15T14:48:32.887Z\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"As we approach the one-year mark since inception of the Usage Incentive Fund, it is high time we take a closer look at its untapped potential.

[...] The contract will be governance controlled so that token holders can decide what applications on the Evmos chain would be eligible for usage incentives farming.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"This effectively is a \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"liquidity mining program\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" that is linked to the base layer, but governance controlled. (think decentralized Avalanche Rush)”\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nTo me personally, the idea of a decentralized Avalanche Rush was extremely compelling. Of course, the management of such a program is not a simple endeavor, but I believe that efforts in this regard would be resources very well spent.\\\\n\\\\nThus far, the community pool served for a few liquidity incentive programs. However, compared to staking incentives these have been comparatively small-scale. \\\\nThe following graphic better illustrates the situation at

believe this huge disparity in incentive allocations is one of the main drivers of the “stake and chill” vibe that has dominated Evmos since its inception. There are simply not enough incentives for the majority of the user base to migrate their staked tokens into DeFi applications. \\\\n\\\\nIn theory, LSTs can help surpass the base staking yield for EVMOS in DeFi applications. However, there still should be incentives that make DeFi more compelling because LSTs can only aid in counterbalancing the minimal risk-free staking yield. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, stEVMOS from Stride has been available for a while, but it has not yet significantly contributed to a more vibrant Evmos ecosystem. I’m hopeful that we’ll see steps in the right direction soon with incentives for Forge, which utilizes LSTs. But small-scale LM programs funded by the community pool are not comparable to the potential that the usage incentive fund could unleash.\\\\n\\\\nAnd it’s not necessarily only users that are attracted by a proper use of the usage incentive fund. Builders are also indirectly incentivized to build applications that governance may decide to incentivize with EVMOS, which in turn increases usage and generated fees for protocols built on Evmos.\\\\nSo, the question emerges: how can we best utilize this fund to create a more vibrant Evmos Ecosystem?\\\\n\\\\nA very simple approach would be to turn the ‘incentive fund’ into a ‘community pool’ structure, only with a different purpose.\\\\n\\\\nA more complex endeavor would be to transform it into some sort of Curve-like system that distributes incentives to certain reward gauges based on voting shares received.

 Govmos Team (a multi-chain volunteer initiative to reform Cosmos governance)\n\nSummary : This proposal seeks to formalize the structure of DAO councils. Introducing 4 \"council types\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce a technical solution to separate security & vote delegation of the tokens. Allowing users to both delegate security to a validator and delegate vote to a council.\n\nAbstract:  Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix ). By doing this we end up with a much more decentralized system where every market participant is represented (appendix 2) compared to the current one in which only team & validators do governance. Each council type having a clear role to play in the ecosystem's governance balance (appendix 3).\n\nMotivation:  Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs.\n\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\n\n1- History :\n\nFollowing from the rejected vote of the proposition #86 ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the community funds requested by the \"main-DAO\". This main-DAO that was recently formalized in the previous proposition #83 by the same persons willing to occupy the DAO seats. First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the candidates & one to request the funding. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would probably push to centralize the system.\n\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted.\n\n2- Govmos Proposition :\n\nNow that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\n\na) Separating Security & Governance Delegation\n\nWe have multiple solutions here, but the endgame is to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power to. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\n\nIF the token holder cast the vote himself THEN the vote is casted\n\nELSE IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\n\nIF he delegated his vote to a council, THEN the council cast the vote on his behalf.\n\nELSE the validator(s) which he delegated to can cast the vote instead.\n\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\n\nb) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\n\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \"council types\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \"council type\" can have as many \"councils\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\n\nHere are the formal amendments :\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" requires all 4 council types to be \"active\".\n\nThe 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\n\nEach council must have separate accounting in the Treasury Module.\n\nEach council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered \"active\"\n\nEach council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\n\nFoundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \"foundation council\".\n\nWallets related to validators + validator delegations (excl. liquid stake) for any \"validators council\".\n\nAddresses having deployed smart contracts for any \"developer council\"\n\nAddresses having never transacted with the above for any \"delegator council\"\n\nCouncils are prohibited to use or request Community Pool funds.\n\nIf the \"main-DAO\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \"Inactive\".\n\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \"active\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. In order to understand which role each council type could play in the DAO, you can refer to the Appendix 2 & 4 at the bottom of that post.\n\nc) Improving on ECP-1A vision\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \"main-DAO\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \"main DAO\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\n\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\n\n3- Govmos vision :\n\nWe want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details. As a pre-proposal stage we are looking forward to have the maximum feedback we can gather. We will try to address every constructive comment.

Introducing 4 \\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce the Treasury Module meant to regulate capital flows of the councils in a transparent and trust-minimized way. As well as signaling an update on the forthcoming Liquid Staking Module (LSM)\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstract:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix). Our proposition states that the most accurate way to auto-regulate the system is to separate capital flows between the councils and define a clear set of standards & rules to regulate such flows. Our model also states that the current system of a \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"sub-DAOs\\\\\\\" workstream is extremely centralized and we will explain why such system has failed in its chain approval process lately. We seek to replace that formal system by implementing 4 types of councils that will compose the aforementioned \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" to maintain its critical center role as decentralized as possible. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Motivation:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1- History :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Following from the rejected vote of the \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/86\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #86\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about the legitimacy of that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the proposition to fund the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". This main-DAO was formalized in the previous \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #83\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\". First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the structure & one to request the funding. By pushing them both in a same proposal the community couldn't vote on each. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would push to centralize the system.\\\\n\\\\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted. \\\\n\\\\n2- Govmos Proposition :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Now that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"a) Signaling an update to the Liquid Staking Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe plan to use the forthcoming LSM (Liquid Staking Module) to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power. This bond can be easily broken by introducing \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Liquid Staked Vote Transport\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" (LSVT). This would allow the voting rights of the liquid staked tokens to be transferred along with them instead of the validators. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\\\\nThe holder can cast his own vote if he wants to.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the liquid staked token is deposited in the Treasury THEN the council who has that delegated token can cast the vote on the holder's behalf.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user has not delegated its token in the Treasury THEN the vote is casted by the validators he has chosen to delegate its security to (the existing model).\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder has chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\\\\nThis step is crucial to our model but the most important part to decentralize governance comes in the next part.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"b) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \\\\\\\"council type\\\\\\\" can have as many \\\\\\\"councils\\\\\\\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\\\\n\\\\nHere are the formal amendments :\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" requires at least one \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\" council for each of the 4 council types.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council must have separate accounting.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered registered\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Foundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \\\\\\\"foundation council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Validators delegated tokens (non liquid-staked) for any \\\\\\\"validators council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having deployed smart contracts for any \\\\\\\"developer council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having never transacted with the above for any \\\\\\\"delegator council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"If the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \\\\\\\"Inactive\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"c) Improving on ECP-1A vision\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \\\\\\\"main DAO\\\\\\\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \\\\\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\\\\\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\\\\n\\\\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"d) Prepare Discussion on the Treasury Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe also consider essential to have each council having a separate accounting in the forthcoming Treasury Module; it will be in charge of regulating capital flows in the councils with smart contracts. This is meant to reduce trust assumptions to the minimum by enforcing the rules that allow capital to move inside the council. It shall restricts spending & specify the potential compensations the council members may ask for (using the compensation framework proposed in ECP-1B which we think can be applied in its current form without amendments). \\\\n\\\\nBut we insist that the money flows inside councils MUST be regulated in a specific chain module via smart contracts. This process should not require ratification by on-chain governance (as opposed to community pool allocation) as its to the discretion of each council to formalize its own internal operating rules & compensation frameworks. \\\\n\\\\nWe have detailed the reasons why different councils may have different models in our research publication (cf. appendix 4)\\\\nThe token holders will have to do their due-diligence before delegating their liquid staked tokens to a council via the treasury module. As some councils may use the delegated funds to pay for regular expenses & the compensation framework (see page 4 of the research). Of course on a separate proposal we will explore the base protection & standards required to these treasury module smart contracts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3- Govmos vision :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONCLUSION\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Authors:** \n\n- LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend. With a participation rate of almost 90%, the Governance Workstream will most likely be fighting to maintain the status quo, as we are almost at the ceiling.\n\n| Rank | Network  | Voter Turnout | Sample Data (20 Props) | Data |\n| ---- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |-------------|\n| 1    | Evmos    | 87.35%        | Proposals 44 - 64                 | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1701165887)  |\n| 2    | Juno     | 82.88%        | Proposals 14 - 39                   | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=248293121)  |\n| 3    | Osmosis  | 64.74%        | Proposals 319 - 340                | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1919390603)   |\n| 4    | Stargaze | 61.85%        | Proposals 30 - 53                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=508354030) |\n| 5    | Cosmos   | 47.49%        | Proposals 56 - 77                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=206262929) |\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7I6nd2O.png)\n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nIn addition to all the proposals that have gone on-chain, the Evmos Community has seen a tremendous, sustained growth in off-chain governance participation, specifically on Commonwealth.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/413Pd2P.png)\n\n---\n\n### Workstream Members and Organizational Structure\n\n**Workstream Structure**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of \n - This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the stewards rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy.\n - Workstream leaders in their second term are automatically elected to a Governance Council Director role.\n - In practice, it is expected that Council Contributors and Council Directors operate and communicate as equals.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 267,614 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 500,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 700,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,792,614 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles. The goal of these full-time contributor roles is to find the next leaders that will step up and establish their own workstreams. \\n\\n - Department of Education\\n \\n     - The mission of the Department of Education is to develop, maintain, and promote educational contents and programs for the Evmos Community. \\n     - This includes the creation of interactive educational content in governance related topics, and eventually the creation of technical content for developers.\\n\\n - Department of Communications\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of Communications is responsible for creating and coordinating direct dialogue between the Evmos DAO and the diverse Community Members.\\n     - Through outreach, communication, townhall meetings, and official announcements from the Governance Council and the various workstreams of the DAO, the Dept. of Communications removes obstacles and barriers and creates opportunities to improve public awareness and involvement in the DAO.\\n     - The Department of Communications will also be responsible for the creation of documentation and communication channels in non-English languages.\\n     - The Department of Communications helps build and maintain the transparent, responsible, and accountable governance system that the Constitution calls for.\\n\\n\\n - Department of Growth & Outreach\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of Growth will be responsible for the strategic outreach and engagement of developers, projects, and other DAOs for the purpose of ecosystem growth.\\n     - Through the generation of leads, coordination with biz dev, outreach campaigns, and strategic bounties, the Department of Growth should ramp up community engagement, elevate the Evmos brand and awareness, illustrate our vision, mission, and values, and enable the facilitation of easy onboarding of projects and developers.\\n\\n\\n - Department of Research & Development\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of R&D will work closely with the Governance Council to research, develop, and maintain key infrastructure, public goods, and the development of smart contracts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Compensation Calculations**\\n\\n|Name |PT/FT | Base

Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment |   Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 | \n| --------      | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty     | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. |  Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training.  | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size  | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role.  | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill.

Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders. \n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: \n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking. \n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members. \n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle: \n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1     | Self       | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties.     |\n| 1.5     | Workstream / subDAO       | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream.  |\n| 2     | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3.     |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO. \n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":2491,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":5,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-10T18:08:15.675Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-09T17:37:12.548Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Standardized Compensation Framework\\n\\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy.

ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\n\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \n\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \n\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\n\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \n - Community-governed incentives program\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\n\n\n## Motivation \n\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \n\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\n\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \n\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\n\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \n\n\n---\n\n\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\n\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \n\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\n\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\n\n\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\n\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\n\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \n\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \n\n---\n\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\n\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \n\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\n\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \n\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\n\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \n\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\n\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \n\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\n\n\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\n\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community. We hope that our previous efforts are recognized by the Community and is a testament to our genuine dedication to the advancement of the Evmos ecosystem and network. \n\nThe target operational, development, and incentives runway with this funding request is **one year**; however, we hope to extend that runway as much as possible through various programs. On the other hand, the absolute best case scenario for the DAO would be to achieve self-sustainability by late next year. \n\n| # | Initiative | Description | Allocation  | \n| - | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Workstream (SubDAO) Funding | Compensation of current and future workstream members and the funding of workstream initiatives. | 20%     |\n| 2 | GOV Tokenomics & Community Gauges | The $GOV token and the gauge system is designed to decentralize Liquidity Incentives allocation, promote long-term alignments, and facilitate off-chain governance voting. | 12.5%     |\n| 3 | Boosted Liquidity Vaults & veGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that are community-led, more transparent, DEX-agnostic, and shared benefits. | 22.5%     |\n| 4 | Perpetual Bounty Fund & deGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that is community-led, more transparent, and is DEX-agnostic. | 10%     | \n| 5 | Treasury Growth & yGOV | Initial funding for DeFi revenue generation strategies and yield-bearing GOV tokens | 7.5%     |\n| 6 | Treasury Bonds | Building community-owned liquidity through the sales of treasury issued bonds. | 5%     |\n| 7 | Strategic Reserves | The reserves will be used only when strategic opportunities are presented to the DAO or rebalancing of the treasury is necessary. In particular, DAO2DAO token-stable swaps will be sought after to diversify our assets into stablecoins without creating market sell pressure.   | 20%     |\n\n- All remaining funds that are not immediately needed will be considered as strategic reserves and remain in the main treasury until ready for deployment (i.e. while we wait for new workstreams to be established, deployment of contracts, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## GOVMOS ($GOV) Utility & Tokenomics\n\nThe GOV token will be the main driver of our off-chain governance, incentive alignments, long-term sustainability, and decentralization efforts. A combination of tried and true strategies as well as novel implementations in DeFi and smart contracting will be utilized. Heavy inspiration is drawn from well-established and successful DAOs that have pioneered the way in governance philosophies and decentralized finance and economics: MakerDAO, Compound, Curve, Yearn, Gnosis, 1Hive, Uniswap, Sushi, Aave, ShapeShift, Balancer, MolochDAO, and many more.\n\n### GOV: Evmos DAO Governance Base Token Layer\n\nAlignment between the Evmos DAO governance token (GOVMOS, or GOV for short) holders and protocol stakeholders (EVMOS) is crucial for an *efficient* decentralized governance -- GOV tokens are the vehicle to drive this alignment. GOV tokens are not a financial investment, although there will be economic benefits. GOV token holders are typically DAO contributors and Evmos Community members who are committed to seeing the continued growth of the Evmos ecosystem, and want a seat at the governance table.\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work — reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and voting on every matter can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain.\n\nThis approach is not to be a gatekeeper of decisions - anyone who wishes will be able to participate. The key difference between on-chain proposals and off-chain DAO proposals is that DAO governance is *voluntary*. \n\n$GOV will be launched as an ERC20 with a 1:1 EVMOS backing. In simpler terms, depositing one EVMOS token will mint you one GOV token; reciprocally, returning one GOV token will release one EVMOS token. GOV tokens are transferrable, fungible, and tradeable. GOV serves as the base layer token for the many functions of its derivatives. **Holding GOV tokens do not grant any voting power.**\n\n**Important concept to remember:** `$GOVMOS` is essentially `$WEVMOS` but with expanded feature sets that allow the DAO and community participants to create and govern the following derivatives and programs. \n\n### GOV Derivatives Overview\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WN7f8LC.png)\n\n\n### veGOV: Aligned & Incentivized Decentralized Decision Making\n\nParticipating in Evmos DAO governance requires that a wallet have a balance of vote-escrowed GOV (veGOV). veGOV is a non-standard ERC20 implementation, popularized and battle-tested by DAOs on Ethereum, that determines each wallet's voting power.\n\nveGOV is obtained by depositing and locking GOV into the DAO's escrow contract. The maximum lock time is two years, and the minimum one month. \n\nThe amount of veGOV received is proportional to the lock-time selected - locking 100 GOV for the maximum two year period will return 100 veGOV. A one year lock of 100 GOV would return 50 veGOV, and so forth. \n\nOnce veGOV is issued to a wallet the tokens will automatically begin decaying at a 1/2 slope linear rate until the time-lock period is reached. For example, if 500 veGOV tokens were rewarded at the time of deposit, 250 veGOV would remain at the time when the vesting period is complete and the original GOV tokens are available for withdrawal. \n\nUsers may decide to keep the original GOV tokens vested even after the completion date in order to retain the remaining veGOV. However, as soon as the original GOV tokens are claimed back into the originating wallet, the remaining veGOV will burn itself.\n\nThe vote-escrowed approach plays several crucial roles in the DAO's governance and our long term goals:\n\n1) Significantly reduces Sybil and other attack vectors in off-chain governance proposals\n2) Ensures that participants are aligned with the long-term goals of the DAO and our vision\n3) Incentivizes governance participation with boosted yields\n4) Will be the main driver of the Liquidity Incentives Program 2.0 with community-governed incentives allocation and DEX-agnostic TVL growth\n5) Generates recurring revenue and treasury diversification through DAO-owned liquidity\n\n**Liquidity Gauges**: A pre-determined amount of EVMOS tokens will be allocated towards Liquidity Incentives each month. veGOV weight from community participants will ultimately dictate the allocation of incentives for each liquidity pool. \n\nThrough the gauge system we are able to run our liquidity incentives program perpetually and in a much more decentralized, fair, and community-centric method. \n\n**Multi-Token Liquidity Mining**: Each pool's Gauge contract can distribute up to 5 different kinds of tokens. This allows for multiple partners/protocols/DAOs to incentivize a given pool by adding their own tokens. \n\nThe goal of the Liquidity Guages is to be as permissionless and community-governed as possible. However, the Governance Council may blacklist tokens from being able to be deposited as an incentivization token to combat spam.\n\n**Liquidity Vaults (Lockers)**: DAO-owned liquidity vaults (farms) will be deployed to maintain our stance of neutrality and allow the natural growth and healthy competition between DEXs and DeFi protocols. \n\nIn an effort to facilitate the steady growth of Evmos' TVL and liquidity, incentives will be boosted for those who commit to a bonding period when depositing their LP tokens. Auto-compounding contracts will also be deployed and utilized to maximize the yield for depositors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KcoDXpG.png)\n\n**Current Problem**: While Prop 64 provided the Evmos network the much needed native liquidity, the proposal was not designed to be a long-term solution. The TVL that has been built is held hostage by the high farming APRs provided at the expense of the Community Pool. The lack of any lockup mechanism also encourages \"pool hopping\" leading to potentially volatile liquidity and subsequently volatile price movements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4ScBYt4.png)\n\n \n### deGOV: Governance Rewards for Network Decentralization Assistance\n\nDelegated GOV tokens, or deGOV are similar to veGOV in that they hold voting weight. However, while veGOV is deflationary once received, deGOV gains voting weight the longer they are staked with the DAO. deGOV tokens are minted at a 1:2 ratio, meaning a 10 GOV deposit will return 5 deGOV.\n\ndeGOV does not have a maximum time-lock period, but will stop accruing voting power at 24 months, with a voting weight boost of 2x of the original deposit. The minimum bonding time is one month,\n\n**The Perpetual Bounty Fund**\n\ndeGOV will play a key role in the maintaining the sustainability of the Community Perpetual Bounty Fund. The concept of the Perpetual Bounty Fund straightforward - the DAO participates in network staking for the purpose of creating a self-replenishing fund for bounties, contributor payments, and special initiatives. \n\n- The authz module is utilized to re-stake “maintenance” token amounts to offset the daily changing APR.\n- A portion of the daily rewards (TBD) are sent to a claiming contract in which deGOV holders may wish to claim their share of the staking rewards.\n- The remainder of the rewards are claimed and sent back into a DAO treasury wallet used for bounties and funding initiatives. \n- If the bounty fund's growth is far exceeding the pace of outbound funds, the DAO may choose to re-route the funds to another program or into the Strategic Reserve fund.\n\nBounties can range from internal growth initiatives to external outreach campaigns. An internal growth example would be to bounty out a SourceCred deployment on Evmos to incentivize participation in governance, encourage constructive discussions, nurture a culture of helping others, etc. The potential bounties and programs can also act as an assistance tool for the core devs by contributing in areas like the improvement and expansion of the Evmos documentation. \n\nAs we eagerly wait for our community to grow and have leaders step up in the creation of new workstreams, bounties are an excellent tool to not only lighten the already heavy workload, but to attract talent, long-term contributors, and future leaders.\n\n**Delegation Gauges**: Similar to Liquidity Gauges, the community will have the power to decide the allocation amounts for 75% of the delegateable tokens from the Perpetual Bounty Fund. The Governance Council, although unlikely to happen often, reserves the right to decide the monthly delegation amounts of the remaining 25%.\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is restricted from delegating to any validator in the top 25 by VP, calculated at the last day of each month. Any votes towards the top 25 validators will be disregarded and allocations distributed proportionately to the eligible validators.  \n\n### yGOV: Yield Bearing Single-Sided Staking Rebase Tokens\n\nYield bearing GOV (or yGOV) are obtained by depositing GOV into an escrow contract controlled by the DAO. **yGOV does not have any voting weight.**\n\nyGOV is a rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with GOV. EVMOS tokens that are represented by the deposited GOV will be deployed into the network's DeFi ecosystem to generate optimized yields. The rebasing occurs shortly after every Evmos epoch and the yields are transferred directly to the users. This allows the constant accural of yields without the need for any action from the end user. \n\nThe redemption (unbonding) time for yGOV is 15 days. Instant withdrawals may be possible depending on the reserve liquidity available at that the time, but will incur a harsh 25% penalty fee. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R48AOko.png)\n\n\n**Liquidity Reserve**: A small reserve liquidity for the yGOV<>GOV swap contract will be maintained for those who are in an emergency and willing to incur the penalty fee.\n\n**yvGOV (Yield-Bearing Vested GOV)** is another GOV deriviative that is being researched. yvGOV will be a vested version of yGOV, with similar characteristics of veGOV. \n\n## Treasury Bonds Market\n\nProtocol owned liquidity (POL) is an important topic that is constantly brought up as one of the most important aspects of growing a healthy treasury. While POL is mostly used in the context of DeFi protocols' and product/service DAOs' treasuries, Evmos DAO is unique in that we are serving a community of an entire Layer-1 Blockchain. Thus, we feel justified in using the term \"Community Owned Liquidity.\" Just as we defend the integrity of the Evmos Constitution and our Governance System, we must fight to defend the value of our network. \n\n**Benefits of Community Owned Liquidity**\n\n- Diversification of Assets\n- Revenue Generation from Swap Fees\n- Long-term Aligned Ecosystem Growth\n- Stable Network-Wide Liquidity\n\n[WIP]\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":2491,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","view_count":7,"read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:32:35.427Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\\n\\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \\n\\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\\n\\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \\n - Community-governed incentives program\\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\\n\\n\\n## Motivation \\n\\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \\n\\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\\n\\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \\n\\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\\n\\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \\n\\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\\n\\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\\n\\n\\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\\n\\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\\n\\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \\n\\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\\n\\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \\n\\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\\n\\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \\n\\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\\n\\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \\n\\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\\n\\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \\n\\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\\n\\n\\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\\n\\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 606,000 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 300,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 600,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,831,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles.
