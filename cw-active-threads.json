inspiration from another post from the community, This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition for the voting options “Yes”, “No”, “Abstain”, and “NoWithVeto” in Evmos governance that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community. These definitions are taken directly from the Evmos docs, and will be further formalized with this vote.\n\nAbstain : indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n\nYes : indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNo : indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNoWithVeto : indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No . If the number of NoWithVeto  votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain  votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned .\n\nAn additional point of discussion is if a proposal to nullify and void any proposal that attempted to add implied meanings to “NO”, “ABSTAIN”, or “NO WITH VETO” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal. A clarifying proposal that states the actual meaning of NO for past proposals is also another route that can be explored.\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecently, there have been proposals that have attempted to redefine the meanings of the voting options in a governance process. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters, which can in turn undermine the will of the voters. To ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the views of the community, it is crucial to clearly define the meanings of the voting options and design the governance process in a way that promotes fairness and effectiveness.\n\nFor example, in Evmos governance a \"no\" vote is generally understood to mean that the voter is opposed to the proposal and does not want it to be implemented. An \"abstain\" vote means that the voter is neutral on the proposal and does not wish to express a position either for or against it. A \"no with veto\" vote means the voter is strongly opposed and in most cases will lead to the proposal deposit being burned.\n\nIt can be dangerous to add or change meanings to the voting options in a governance process because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters. Additionally, adding implied meanings to the voting options can undermine the transparency and fairness of the governance process. If voters do not understand the full implications of their votes, they may make decisions that are not in line with their true views or the best interests of the community. This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community.\n\nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community.\n\nThis proposal aims to set the following meanings that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community:\n\nAbstain : indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n\nYes : indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNo : indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\nNoWithVeto : indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No . If the number of NoWithVeto  votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain  votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned .\n\nAn additional point of discussion is if a proposal to nullify and void any proposal that attempted to change the meanings of “No”, “Abstain”, or “NoWithVeto” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal.

This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal aims to set the following meanings that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community:\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstain\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Yes\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"No\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"NoWithVeto\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://docs.evmos.org/users/governance/process.html#burned-deposits\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"burned\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA point for discussion is if a proposal that also nullify and voids any proposal that attempted to add implied meanings to “NO”, “ABSTAIN”, or “NO WITH VETO” in order to preserve the will of the community should be made, if we include that clause in this proposal, or if we do not feel it is necessary to do so with the formalization of this proposal. A clarifying proposal that states the actual meaning of NO for past proposals is also another route that can be explored.\\\\n\\\\nOpen to any and all feedback and welcome discussion from the community.\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":null,"created_at":"2023-01-06T03:28:19.720Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T12:16:52.163Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-01-08T12:16:52.163Z","Address":{"id":47245,"address":"evmos14rsst0wnenhpxqv0drtvmz5jegp2dtcpf0srcl","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-09-15T22:33:16.451Z","keytype":null,"name":"Tricky | Evmos","last_active":"2023-01-18T18:14:49.791Z","user_id":43332,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":40615,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":43332},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1357,"name":"7.

starting this discussion to address what I believe to be a serious and willful governance attack on the Evmos chain. While I will make recommendations in this discussion that I hope will result in future governance proposals, this discussion isn't intended to go on chain itself.\n\nOver the past few days, contributors to the Laurel Project (https://twitter.com/provable_laurel) have put a number of what I consider to be malicious proposals on chain. These proposals are:\n\nProposal 95\n\nProposal 98\n\nProposal 99\n\nThey have also submitted additional proposals in the past several weeks that may or may not fall under the category of malicious, but it's these three proposals in particular that I wish to focus on for the reasons set forth below. Note that in many of these proposals, the Laurel Project attempts to paint the \"No\" vote option as meaning something other than \"The Evmos chain governance rejects this proposal.\"\n\nThe discussion will center around the Laurel Project's documented threat to sue the Evmos DAO and Evmos core contributors, because I believe this to be the reason that these proposals are now on chain and were proposed on advice of counsel (explained in more detail below). For background on the Laurel Project's threat to sue, please see https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md . Screenshots below in case this link is ever deleted:\n\n(image)\n\nI reference this as a background so that we can look at these latest proposals through a lens of what someone who is preparing for litigation might do to increase their odds of success. One of the best sources of evidence in litigation is an opposing party's documented admissions. By crafting the language around a \"NO\" vote or a non-passage outcome carefully, the Laurel project is attempting to force Evmos governance to make admissions / statements that they can later use in court (as voting options are limited and lack nuance). Now, let's dive into the proposals themselves with this in mind:\n\nProposal 95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)\n\nThis proposal lays the groundwork (albeit VERY poorly) for a potential cause of action against Evmos. I don't believe this would be successful, but it's still important to note that this proposal's \"NO\" vote option includes the following language:\n\nThe legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort.\n\nI'm not sure they understand what \"volunteer\" means, but at any rate, were this to be deemed as an admission of Evmos governance, it could potentially be problematic as an admission that money is owed here.\n\nAlso worth noting that both of the validators controlled by the Laurel Project, Evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers voted \"NO\" on this proposal.\n\nProposal 98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain\n\nThis proposal seeks, on its face, to have a system of elected officers that represent the chain in an official capacity. Why is this important from a legal perspective? One of the most difficult things about suing a decentralized project is finding an appropriate representative party to sue / serve with process. In a traditional corporation / LLC, this would be one of the corp's owners / officers.\n\nIt appears that the Laurel Project is painfully aware of this, as the text of this proposal indicates that clarifying a party to represent the chain in a legal capacity is one of the proposal's goals:\n\nNon-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:\n\nprovide transparency of:\n\n- power structure\n\n- actions done for the benefit of the chain\n\n- provide evidence of decentralization\n\n- clarify the assignment of responsibility\n\n- welcome cooperation with other chains\n\n- obtain delegation of representation\n\n- expand the types of actions the chain can govern\n\n- legitimize legal representation\n\n- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)\n\nImportantly, it doesn't really matter whether this proposal passes or not. If the proposal passes, the Laurel project may attempt use this vote as evidence that the chain has authorized certain individuals to represent it in a legal capacity (and can therefore be sued / served in a representative capacity). It also helps establish jurisdiction as a location where these individuals are located.\n\nIf the proposal doesn't pass, the language \"the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody\" is concerning, as they may attempt to use this as an admission that any DAO member (token holder) may be sued in a representative capacity for the entirety of the chain and Evmos token holders.\n\nProposal 99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions\n\nThis one seems mostly inflammatory / directed at drawing regulatory or criminal investigation. It sounds as though a \"NO\" vote here will be used to press criminal charges against the chain for something related to the alleged nonpayment for the Laurel Project's volunteer services.\n\nif this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law\n\nThe terms of art used here indicate to me that they've sought legal counsel around putting up this proposal (\"premeditation\" specifically speaks to an intent element required for many criminal causes of action).\n\nPotential Mitigation Steps and Punitive Measures\n\nRegardless of whether these efforts will be successful or not, I firmly believe that the governance actions taken by the Laurel project in the last few weeks constitute a deliberate and malicious attack on the chain and a manipulation of the governance process for the personal gain of the Laurel Project and its contributors. If Evmos governance is of the same mind, there are a few measures we can take to mitigate any potential damage of and / or punish the Laurel Project for these actions.\n\nMeasure 1: Ratify governance-official meanings for Yes, No, and NoWithVeto\n\nThis is a mitigation step to prevent abuses like this from happening in the future. At minimum, Yes, and No should have meanings defined by governance that supersede what is mentioned in any other proposal. To be safe, this should also be made retroactive to clarify what was meant by votes that the DAO has already made.\n\nWhat these definitions are should be subject to healthy community discussion in a separate thread.\n\nMeasure 2: Vote to tombstone the Evmos4volunteers and Votes4volunteers validators\n\nAdmittedly, this punitive measure is a bit extreme and should be considered very carefully before being implemented. These two validators are under the control of the Laurel Project and / or Laurel Project contributors. The continued control of significant voting power in the hands of actors that are deemed malicious represents a threat to the short and long-term health of the chain.\n\nI'm not wholly familiar with the tech intricacies of what might be required to implement this, but I think this could be done via a software upgrade that sets the status of these validators to tombstoned. Ideally this could be done without slashing the delegators but again, this is something that should be discussed in a separate thread.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the governance actions of the Laurel Project have (appropriately) been mostly the subject to ridicule and anger, I believe the broader Evmos community doesn't recognize the potential threat that these actions represent to the chain and the governance process. This post is intended to start a serious conversation around this subject, whether my recommendations are implemented or not.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1357,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-01-05T23:37:21.880Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1cd80nuy940v4epql0vn2tjc3qmd2vz3y6prjwz\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"RoboMcGobo\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-01-05T21:18:04.268Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"I'm starting this discussion to address what I believe to be a serious and willful governance attack on the Evmos chain.

Now, let's dive into the proposals themselves with this in mind: \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal lays the groundwork (albeit VERY poorly) for a potential cause of action against Evmos. I don't believe this would be successful, but it's still important to note that this proposal's \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" vote option includes the following language: \\\\n\\\\nThe legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nI'm not sure they understand what \\\\\\\"volunteer\\\\\\\" means, but at any rate, were this to be deemed as an admission of Evmos governance, it could potentially be problematic as an admission that money is owed here.\\\\n\\\\nAlso worth noting that both of the validators controlled by the Laurel Project, Evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers voted \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" on this proposal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal seeks, on its face, to have a system of elected officers that represent the chain in an official capacity. Why is this important from a legal perspective? One of the most difficult things about suing a decentralized project is finding an appropriate representative party to sue / serve with process. In a traditional corporation / LLC, this would be one of the corp's owners / officers.\\\\n\\\\nIt appears that the Laurel Project is painfully aware of this, as the text of this proposal indicates that clarifying a party to represent the chain in a legal capacity is one of the proposal's goals: \\\\n\\\\nNon-exhaustive list of what is obtained, improved, or encouraged by passing this proposal:\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"provide transparency of:\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- power structure\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- actions done for the benefit of the chain\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- provide evidence of decentralization\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- clarify the assignment of responsibility\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- welcome cooperation with other chains\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- obtain delegation of representation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- expand the types of actions the chain can govern\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- legitimize legal representation\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"- legitimize officers using the chain itself (increased independence of legitimacy)\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nImportantly, it doesn't really matter whether this proposal passes or not. If the proposal passes, the Laurel project may attempt use this vote as evidence that the chain has authorized certain individuals to represent it in a legal capacity (and can therefore be sued / served in a representative capacity). It also helps establish jurisdiction as a location where these individuals are located.\\\\n\\\\nIf the proposal doesn't pass, the language \\\\\\\"the Evmos chain may be represented by anybody and/or nobody\\\\\\\" is concerning, as they may attempt to use this as an admission that any DAO member (token holder) may be sued in a representative capacity for the entirety of the chain and Evmos token holders.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis one seems mostly inflammatory / directed at drawing regulatory or criminal investigation. It sounds as though a \\\\\\\"NO\\\\\\\" vote here will be used to press criminal charges against the chain for something related to the alleged nonpayment for the Laurel Project's volunteer services.\\\\n\\\\nif this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"blockquote\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe terms of art used here indicate to me that they've sought legal counsel around putting up this proposal (\\\\\\\"premeditation\\\\\\\" specifically speaks to an intent element required for many criminal causes of action).\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Potential Mitigation Steps and Punitive Measures\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of whether these efforts will be successful or not, I firmly believe that the governance actions taken by the Laurel project in the last few weeks constitute a deliberate and malicious attack on the chain and a manipulation of the governance process for the personal gain of the Laurel Project and its contributors. If Evmos governance is of the same mind, there are a few measures we can take to mitigate any potential damage of and / or punish the Laurel Project for these actions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Measure 1: Ratify governance-official meanings for Yes, No, and NoWithVeto\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis is a mitigation step to prevent abuses like this from happening in the future. At minimum, Yes, and No should have meanings defined by governance that supersede what is mentioned in any other proposal. To be safe, this should also be made retroactive to clarify what was meant by votes that the DAO has already made.\\\\n\\\\nWhat these definitions are should be subject to healthy community discussion in a separate thread.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Measure 2: Vote to tombstone the Evmos4volunteers and Votes4volunteers validators\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAdmittedly, this punitive measure is a bit extreme and should be considered very carefully before being implemented. These two validators are under the control of the Laurel Project and / or Laurel Project contributors. The continued control of significant voting power in the hands of actors that are deemed malicious represents a threat to the short and long-term health of the chain.\\\\n\\\\nI'm not wholly familiar with the tech intricacies of what might be required to implement this, but I \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"think\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" this could be done via a software upgrade that sets the status of these validators to tombstoned. Ideally this could be done without slashing the delegators but again, this is something that should be discussed in a separate thread.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Conclusion\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nWhile the governance actions of the Laurel Project have (appropriately) been mostly the subject to ridicule and anger, I believe the broader Evmos community doesn't recognize the potential threat that these actions represent to the chain and the governance process. This post is intended to start a serious conversation around this subject, whether my recommendations are implemented or not. \\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":null,"created_at":"2023-01-05T23:37:21.902Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T03:09:15.812Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2023-01-06T03:09:15.812Z","Address":{"id":89679,"address":"evmos1cd80nuy940v4epql0vn2tjc3qmd2vz3y6prjwz","chain":"evmos","verified":null,"keytype":null,"name":"RoboMcGobo","last_active":"2023-01-06T03:09:36.453Z","user_id":null,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":75861,"wallet_id":"keplr-ethereum","UserId":null},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1357,"name":"7.

I guess a lot of us already heard about GPT-3 chat, but for those who don't, that's an open AI chat platform. Very helpful to summarize some complex information in a readable form for the normal human being.\n\nI thought this would be interesting to share the recent chat I had with the AI on cryptos in general and then narrowing the scope to DAOs and their structuring. This was a hot topic there recently, so maybe having AI insight on the matter may help people to grasp what's a stake.\n\n[I skiped the initial part of the talk, where I gave the AI a context on crypto before moving to DAOs]\n\nME : any thoughts on DAOs ?\n\nGPT : Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are digital organizations that are governed by a set of rules encoded into smart contracts and run on a blockchain. They are designed to be decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity, but are instead governed by the consensus of their members.\n\nDAOs have gained a lot of attention in recent years because of their potential to enable more transparent, efficient, and democratic forms of governance and decision-making. They have the potential to disrupt traditional organizational models and to create new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that DAOs are still a relatively new and untested concept, and there are many challenges and risks associated with their use. For example, DAOs are vulnerable to code vulnerabilities and attacks, and there have been instances where DAOs have been exploited or hacked. Additionally, there are questions about the legal status and accountability of DAOs, and it is not yet clear how they will be treated by regulators and the legal system.\n\nOverall, DAOs are an interesting and promising concept, but they are also still in the early stages of development and adoption, and it is difficult to say for certain what the future holds for them.\n\nME : what could be the attack vectors against DAOs ?\n\nGPT : There are several potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):\n\nSmart contract vulnerabilities: Like any smart contract, a DAO's code is vulnerable to bugs and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. For example, if a DAO's code contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal funds, the attacker could exploit that vulnerability to drain the DAO's funds.\n\nSybil attacks: In a Sybil attack, an attacker creates multiple fake identities and uses them to gain a disproportionate amount of influence within a DAO. This could allow the attacker to sway voting outcomes or to gain control of the DAO.\n\nMajority attack: If an attacker is able to gain control of a majority of the voting power within a DAO, they could use that power to manipulate voting outcomes and to control the DAO's decisions.\n\nFrontrunning: In a frontrunning attack, an attacker monitors the blockchain for pending transactions and then executes their own transactions that depend on the outcome of those pending transactions before they are processed. This could allow the attacker to profit from the pending transactions or to disrupt the operation of the DAO.\n\nPhishing attacks: Like any online organization, a DAO is vulnerable to phishing attacks in which attackers use fake websites or emails to trick users into revealing their login credentials or private keys.\n\nThere are other potential attack vectors as well, and it is important for DAO developers and users to be aware of the risks and to take appropriate measures to protect themselves.\n\nME : what would be the best way to structure DAOs ?\n\nGPT : There is no one \"best\" way to structure a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), as the optimal structure will depend on the specific goals and needs of the DAO. That being said, there are a few key considerations that can be helpful when designing the structure of a DAO:\n\nDecentralization: A key feature of DAOs is that they are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity. It is important for the structure of a DAO to reflect this decentralization, for example by using a distributed governance model or by using a blockchain-based voting system.\n\nTransparency: DAOs should be designed to be transparent, so that all members have access to relevant information and can see how decisions are being made.\n\nRobustness: The structure of a DAO should be designed to be robust and resistant to attacks or disruptions. This may involve using multiple layers of security or implementing measures to mitigate the risks of vulnerabilities or Sybil attacks.\n\nFlexibility: A DAO's structure should be flexible enough to allow it to adapt to changing needs or circumstances. This may involve using a modular design or implementing a system for on-chain governance.\n\nThere are many other factors that can also be important when designing the structure of a DAO, and it is important for DAO developers to carefully consider their specific goals and needs when designing the structure of their DAO.\n\nME : how could we improve the decentralization ?\n\nGPT : There are a number of ways in which the decentralization of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can be improved:\n\nDistributed governance: A distributed governance model, in which decisions are made by a diverse group of stakeholders rather than by a single individual or entity, can help to increase the decentralization of a DAO.\n\nBlockchain-based voting: Using a blockchain-based voting system, such as a proof-of-stake (PoS) system, can help to ensure that voting is transparent, secure, and resistant to tampering.\n\nUse of multiple blockchain platforms: Using multiple blockchain platforms can help to increase the decentralization of a DAO by reducing the risk of a single point of failure.\n\nDecentralized infrastructure: Using decentralized infrastructure, such as decentralized file storage or decentralized DNS, can help to increase the overall decentralization of a DAO.\n\nDiversity of stakeholders: Ensuring that the stakeholders of a DAO are diverse and come from different backgrounds and locations can help to increase the decentralization of the DAO.\n\nIt is important to note that achieving a high degree of decentralization can be challenging, and it may involve trade-offs with other considerations such as scalability and efficiency.\n\nME : should cosmos blockchains run with DAOs ?\n\nGPT : Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can be built on top of the Cosmos platform, and it is possible for Cosmos-based blockchains to incorporate DAO functionality into their design. However, it is not necessary for all Cosmos-based blockchains to use DAOs, and the decision to use a DAO will depend on the specific goals and needs of the blockchain.\n\nDAOs have the potential to provide a transparent, efficient, and democratic form of governance and decision-making, and they can be useful for a wide range of applications. However, they also have their own set of risks and challenges, and it is important for blockchain developers to carefully consider whether a DAO is the right choice for their particular use case.\n\nIn general, the decision to use a DAO or not will depend on the specific needs and goals of the blockchain, as well as the trade-offs that the developers are willing to make in terms of decentralization, security, scalability, and other factors.\n\nME : what kind of trade-offs ?\n\nGPT : There are a number of trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to use a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on a blockchain:\n\nDecentralization vs. efficiency: One trade-off to consider is the balance between decentralization and efficiency. DAOs can provide a decentralized and transparent form of governance, but they may also be slower and less efficient than more centralized alternatives.\n\nSecurity vs. complexity: Another trade-off to consider is the balance between security and complexity. DAOs can be more secure than centralized alternatives, but they can also be more complex to design and manage.\n\nFlexibility vs. stability: DAOs can be designed to be highly flexible, but this can also make them less stable. On the other hand, more rigid structures may be more stable, but less flexible.\n\nLegal and regulatory uncertainty: There is still a lot of uncertainty around the legal and regulatory status of DAOs, which can be a risk for organizations that decide to use them.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the trade-offs that may be involved in the decision to use a DAO, and it is important for organizations to carefully consider their specific goals and needs when deciding whether a DAO is the right choice for them.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf there's something to take away from this, that would be that very last question I asked. We have offered a system here, it's been rejected and we have learned our lesson on that front. There have been some wild critics, some justified, most of them not. We just encourage others to take on our lead and help craft a true DAO system for this chain. This chat with GPT sets the baseline of reflection needed to go ahead.

Very helpful to summarize some complex information in a readable form for the normal human being.\\\\n\\\\nI thought this would be interesting to share the recent chat I had with the AI on cryptos in general and then narrowing the scope to DAOs and their structuring.

They are designed to be decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity, but are instead governed by the consensus of their members.\\\\nDAOs have gained a lot of attention in recent years because of their potential to enable more transparent, efficient, and democratic forms of governance and decision-making. They have the potential to disrupt traditional organizational models and to create new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.\\\\nHowever, it is important to note that DAOs are still a relatively new and untested concept, and there are many challenges and risks associated with their use. For example, DAOs are vulnerable to code vulnerabilities and attacks, and there have been instances where DAOs have been exploited or hacked. Additionally, there are questions about the legal status and accountability of DAOs, and it is not yet clear how they will be treated by regulators and the legal system.\\\\nOverall, DAOs are an interesting and promising concept, but they are also still in the early stages of development and adoption, and it is difficult to say for certain what the future holds for them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"ME : \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"what could be the attack vectors against DAOs ?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"GPT : \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"There are several potential attack vectors that could be used to compromise a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO):\\\\nSmart contract vulnerabilities: Like any smart contract, a DAO's code is vulnerable to bugs and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

are a team of 3 IT guys, with a 13-years of background in the IT business and 7-years in blockchain development.\n\nWe are located in Switzerland\n\nWe develop web3 Dapps and provide high quality infrastructure for public blokchain/Dapps on various networks.\n\nFurthermore, we sincerely believe in a more decentralized world, and we work under that premise.\n\nBackground\n\nWe are in the evmos community since day one, we maintain several nodes and one archive node (thanks god for the v9 ahah)\n\nwe have already done some work as a b2v provider for a reputable team in the ecosystem, I don't want to expose them but if they want i gonna update the post:)\n\nWe are personally exposed on the evmos token too, skin in the game as usual.\n\nAll our product use our bare-metal infra locate in OVH on different localization, we planned to move all that stuff in Switzerland soon.\n\nWhat we've already done\n\n.Nuxian payment – noncustodial and account abstracted smart contract for business payment.\n\n.Nuxian Unbounding Rescue – An app who front run the hacker at block +1 of the unbounding period. We are going to update it to be faster, and we plan to use authz module. That project already saved a bunch of k$.\n\n.Nuxian Node / Archive Node – we provide and maintain several nodes on evmos and different network\n\n.Nuxian Bot – that a discord/Twitter/XMPP/whatever you want Bot, but it has access to many event listeners that can be trigger by the user or be subscribed by the other one. It could do many tasks actually we use it too for community management and recognition.\n\n.Nuxian Validator – we already run a bunch of validators on several chains, but we don't have enought evmos to run one. That's hard to start a community when you're a tech team :) .\n\n.Nuxian erc20 to ibc converter – we have created a public tori erc20 to ibc token.\n\n. Nuxian Castle keeper – that's a token/nft gatekeeper for any resource you want. We use it to protect our RPC access, but you could use that for many other resources.\n\nWhat we do now\n\nTwo project are in the concept pipe :\n\n.

Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role\n\nThis proposal seeks a formal cancellation of Proposal 45, return of funds from Prop 45's multisig to the Community Pool and a clarification of the role of Loredana and Christian on EVMOS due to recent malicious acts and spam proposals.\n\nThis proposal is unfortunately necessary to submit anonymously, due to Loredana and Christian's legal threats, which were committed to Github two weeks ago: [https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md)\n\nAs such it is important to clarify that this proposal is not being made by the EVMOS Foundation or any of it's representatives, and is being brought forth by a community stakeholder of the EVMOS chain who has been witnessing these events unfold. It is my hope that this proposal can bring closure to this governance module spam.\n\n### Clarification of Laurel Project / InterChain Pact Failed Proposals\n\nMany of the recent proposals made by Loredana or Christian seek to interject meaning into what happens if a proposal is rejected - with language such as, \"_if this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law_\".\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to very specifically and pointedly clarify that none of the proposals made by Loredana or Christian which failed to pass have any meaning other than the standard meaning a proposal failure within the typical meaning of the Cosmos SDK: __The Community felt the proposal should not pass, and therefore it has failed. This includes No and NoWithVeto.__\n\n### Previous Behavior\nThis appears to be a pattern of behavior that goes back to their earlier days on Ethereum as well, as can be seen here:\n\n**Harassment of Ethereum developers, circa July 2021:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ocv773/ethereum_and_billionaires_stealing_ideas_from/\n\n\n**Spam Proposals and Misbehavior on EVMOS:**\n\n[#84: The Alternative: An Honest DAO and an Independent Evmos Chain](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/84) (Front-running Proposal 86)\n\n[#86: Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) (Further governance interference on Prop 86)\n\n[#93: Governance Consensus: The Governance Language is English](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/93) (A solution in search of a problem, no point to this proposal)\n\n[#95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/95) (A retroactive funding effort which seeks recognition for volunteer efforts through proposal rejection - they voted no themselves after proposing)\n\n[#98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/98) (Centralization effort to codify elected officers)\n\n[#99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/99) (Implies a rejection of the proposal is an endorsement of criminal behavior)\n\n[#100: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for 2022)](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/100) (Re-spam of previously rejected proposal 95, includes even worse language around \"what NoWithVeto\" means)\n\n[#105: Governance Consensus: Governance Immunity](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/105) (Further manipulation of what yes and no votes mean on a proposal)\n\n[#106: Consensus Test](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/106) (This proposal is a spam proposal which is asking if 1+1=2)\n\n[#106\n[Kava Reddit Thread regarding Ethermint Funding](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal) (Socially unacceptable behavior interacting with the Kava Community)\n\n### Cancellation of Prop 45 and Clarifications of Laurel Project Role\n\n**Loredana (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** proposed that the EVMOS Community pay for lobbying efforts by subsidizing an apartment in Berlin. It has become clear that this volunteer effort is more of a personal mission than an effort to assist in the furtherance of the chain.\n\n**Christian Tzurcanu (votes4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** has assisted in many of these spam proposals as well, and has actively engaged in socially unacceptable governance behavior when interacting with the community and validator set, particularly within Commonwealth Discussions, Reddit and the EVMOS Community Discord.\n\n**As such this proposal seeks to clarify through social consensus the following points:**\n\n1) Loredana Cirstea does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.\n\n2) Christian Tzurcanu does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.\n\n3) The Laurel Project and The InterChain Pact are not officially associated in any way with the EVMOS chain, nor should either of them conduct work on the behalf of the EVMOS chain.\n\n4) Proposal 45 should be cancelled and remaining funds returned to the Community Pool.\n\n5) All language contained within the rejected Proposals 84, 88, 93, 95, 98, 99, 100, 105 and 106 are completely nullified. No language contained with any of these proposals is binding upon the network or it's constituents.

Evmosians!\n\nThree weeks ago, we posted an ideation: New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching , receiving many discussions. According to community's feedbacks and off-chain polls, we have formed this final plan. Hope to get your feedbacks before putting it on chian for voting. Thanks!\n\nThis proposal is to introduce Evmos Liquidity Incentive to spacefi.io and help Evmos liquidity and ecosystem to grow further through the launch of SpaceFi entire products suite (DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad) as well as the SPACE token. The full discussion in commonwealth: New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi Whole Launching\n\nAbstract\n\nSince the previous 2M EVMOS Liquidity Incentive was first launched on Diffusion, Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem has shown encouraging growth. At the same time, we are also experiencing some difficulties. The TVL on Diffusion has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M (2023.01.18). During the process, we found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value. The EVMOS Incentive on Diffusion ended on 2023.01.19.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe're trying some new measures to improve Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem.\n\n1. Concentrated Liquidity\n\nAlthough Evmos has $2.5M in native liquidity, it is mainly split into13 trading pairs. We recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity.\n\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge to concentrate liquidity first. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity.\n\n2. LP Bonding\n\nTo incentivize long-term liquidity providers and to avoid the adverse effects of mercenary liquidity, SpaceFi Farm supports LP Bonding, including no bonding, 7 days unbonding and 14 days unbonding. The longer the LP is locked in the farm, the higher the APR will be.\n\n(image)\n\n3. Ecosystem Building\n\nEvmos Liquidity Incentive is a short-term booster. And the thriving ecosystem projects are the long-term value. SpaceFi has been actively helping new projects get started in Evmos through Incubation and Launchpad Program. We've incubated Soul Network, a cross-chain DID network Cosmos & Ethereum, and also the First Place Winner in the Web3 track of Evmos Hackathon.\n\nAction Plan\n\nAccording to the community's feedbacks, we plan to apply for 1M EVMOS as the liquidity incentive to start, in a program lasting 90 days, and expect to bring $4-$8M native liquidity with ARP 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding), similar to it on Osmosis. The above is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18. If the liquidity grows well, we may apply to increase the incentive for the further growth.\n\n1. Why Liquidity Incentive\n\nEvmos native liquidity is still very small and further improvement of liquidity is a priority. In fact, 1M EVMOS is about 2 days' inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating. The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself.\n\nThis proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching. We hope to bring more use cases for Evmos and more confidence to the ecosystem and community through SpaceFi's performance.\n\n2. Use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly\n\nThe xEVMOS module is aimed to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping.\n\nWe'll launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, converted 1:1 from the EVMOS requested.\n\nxEVMOS earned from liquidity incentive can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30 days unbonding period. Users can also choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The other 50% will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.\n\nWith xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. The liquidity incentive can last more than 90 days if some users choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately. We can also offer xEVMOS module as a public good for other incentive programs in Evmos ecosystem.\n\n(image)\n\n3.

The initial rewards are allocated as follows:\n\nMAJOR: 50%, 5555 EVMOS / day + 29165 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / ATOM - total 250k EVMOS + 1312380 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / ETH - total 175k EVMOS + 918720 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / BTC - total 125k EVMOS + 393750 SPACE\n\nSTABLE: 35%, 3888 EVMOS / day + 20414 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / USDC - total 350k EVMOS + 1837260 SPACE\n\nMINOR: 15%, 1666 EVMOS / day + 8754 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / OSMO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / JUNO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / SPACE - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nThe reward weight for each pair can be adjusted each two weeks based on liquidity & volume data.\n\nTVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 146% (no bonding) - 293% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 73% (no bonding) - 146% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 4M-8M, APR 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding)\n\nThe above TVL and APR is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18.\n\nCheck Detailed Chart\n\n(image)\n\nThis is not just another proposal for Liquidity Incentive\n\nSpaceFi is a community project with no VC funding, and has been building in the EVMOS ecosystem since February 2022 at our own expense. We want to make it an engine in the ecosystem with DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad, not just a DEX. At the same time as the EVMOS Liquidity Incentive begins, we will fully launch the SpaceFi product and SPACE token.\n\nThe initial emission of SPACE token will be about 125000 SPACE / day, 70% of which will be used for farming rewards, i.e. 87500 SPACE / day.

It has been building in Evmos ecosystem since 2022.02. More than 40k users have tested SpaceFi products on Evmos and zkSync testnet.\n\nSpaceFi has previously conducted extensive testing and completed three contract audits. Here are the Audit Reports by QuillAudits , a leading smart contract audit firm who has secured more than 700+ web3 projects with $15B+. A new audit report about xEVMOS module will also be released soon. We'll make the products well tested and audited before the whole launching.\n\nAudit Report-3 | Audit Report-2 | Audit Report-1","kind":"discussion","stage":"Proposal","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-01-12T11:56:13.516Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1mk98x7jvsmmnymlypphmyddug7wpc4ur0zralz\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"cryptoallen|spacefi.io\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"builder of SpaceFi\\\\n\\\\nSpaceFi is a cross-chain web3 platform with DEX+NFT+Launchpad+Spacebase on Evmos and zkSync.\\\\n\\\\nwebsite: https://www.spacefi.io/\\\\n\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/b082f11f-f16f-436f-8d4c-e6539f95d1f2.png\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-01-12T06:56:21.204Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Hey Evmosians!\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"A few days ago, we posted a pre-proposal: \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-preproposal-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching\\\",\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\" and received many discussions.

At the same time, we are also experiencing some difficulties. The TVL on Diffusion has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M (2023.01.10). During the process, we found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value.\\\\n\\\\nStrategy\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We're trying some new measures to improve Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1.

We recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge to concentrate liquidity first. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"2.

The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself.\\\\n\\\\nThis proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching.

Users can also choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The other 50% will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.\\\\n\\\\nWith xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining a high APR attraction and incentivizing long-term holders.

is Dora x Evmos Network GrantDAO\n\nDora GrantDAO is a sustainable initiative to provide grants, hackathon prizes, and support for early-stage Web3 projects with the infrastructure and community resources of DoraHacks , the largest Web3 multi-chain developer incentive platform.\n\nDora x Evmos Network GrantDAO aims to jointly nurture essential public goods and new projects/startups in the Evmos Network ecosystem by providing grants, hackathon prizes, and incubation/investment opportunities. With sustainable yield generated from the node operated by DoraHacks, sufficient incentive will be provided to hundreds of new teams building on the Evmos Network. Dora x Evmos Network GrantDAO will be co-managed by DoraHacks and the Evmos Network team.\n\nDora x Evmos Network GrantDAO Commercial terms\n\nDoraHacks will operate one public good node (multiple nodes in the future) in the Evmos Network ecosystem to help validate the network and use the node proceeds to provide grants/hackathon prize pools to developers and teams building on Evmos Network. Our validator commission will be 100%.\n\nIdeally, we’ll seek a $300K worth delegation of $Evmos from the Evmos Network Foundation. 100% of the proceeds will inject into Dora x Evmos Network GrantDAO. 70% of the proceeds will go to developers as incentives. 30% will go to Dora GrantDAO, covering expenses.\n\nUnder the APY of 120%, $360k worth of yield can be generated annually and channeled to new developer teams.\n\nGrantDAO Functions\n\n40% ($144K worth of $Evmos) of generated proceeds will be mainly used as prize rewards for Evmos Network seasonal Hackathons/Grants on DoraHacks.io every year.\n\nFrom our experience, $100K worth of prize pool can incentivize 50-100 teams to join and build in the Evmos Network ecosystem. Additional proceeds can be channeled to other hackathons, university grant programs, and dev-related events to help promote Evmos Network in global developer communities.\n\nWe aim to attract 100-200+ teams to join the hackathon and curate around 10-20 teams that will play an essential role in the Evmos Network ecosystem.\n\nPrevious Dora hackathons:\n\nBNB Grant - 1: 216 submissions ( CryptoSat , Zecrey )\n\nAvalanche Hackathon: 151 submissions ( Mystiko , Via.exchange )\n\nSolana Season Hackathon: 94 submissions ( Solend , 1Sol )\n\nPolygon Grant Hackathon: 137 submissions ( Showme , Cruzo )\n\nETHDenver IRL: 171 submissions ( IdentDefi , Deux La Securitas )\n\n30% ($108K worth of $Evmos) of generated proceeds will be used to invest/fund/grant some best projects from the seasonal hackathons on DoraHacks or crucial public goods in the Evmos Network ecosystem.\n\n30% ($108K worth of $Evmos) of generated proceeds will be used as operating expenses.\n\nDora GrantDAO Case study: Aptos\n\nAptos Foundation delegation: 16.9 million APT tokens (around $68 million)\n\nDoraHacks(Dora Factory) validator is running right now, and we are rewarding the best builders in the Aptos ecosystem. We have concluded the first round of Aptos GrantDAO on DoraHacks, using 8000 APT tokens generated from the validator as a partial funding pool.\n\nIn 40 days, we received more than 150 project applications, verified 137 as official participants, and selected 15 best teams from them as finalists.\n\nYou can find more information here: https://dorahacks.io/aptos/2/ .\n\nA Sneaky Peaky about Aptos GrantDAO 1 winner (partial):\n\nAptin.Fi : the first lending protocol built on Aptos.\n\nFewcha Wallet : a self-custody crypto wallet for DeFi & NFTs on Move blockchains, empowered by the first NFT DAO model in the industry\n\nOmniBTC : the first omnichain financial platform based on cross-chain interoperability protocols. It has three core functions, OmniSwap, OmniBridge, and OmniLending.\n\nMira.fi : an index fund that give investors exposure to assets on multiple chains in one click, built for Move\n\nMoveDID : a DID protocol compatible with Move-based blockchain networks, including Aptos, Sui, and Starcoin.\n\nAptosPassport : Aptos Passport(APass) is a protocol that integrates Domains, DIDs, and SBT. It will be referenced on-chain to shape your unique charm.\n\nDoraHacks invested in 2 Aptos ecosystem projects:\n\nEconia Labs : Econia is a decentralized, open-source, order book trading protocol developed on the Aptos chain. in addition to being a hyperparallel on-chain order book for the Aptos blockchain that aggregates liquidity in the digital marketplace, more importantly, its interface is also a rich API suite on which anyone can build their custom implementation.

by\n\nTricky, Benny Lava, LPX (Evmos) with the help of Dhtal (ICHI)\n\nSummary\n\nThe ICHI team in partnership with the Evmos community will work to deploy an ICHI Vault on Ethereum for EVMOS tokens.\n\nFollowing the completion of this vault, the ICHI team will work with the Evmos community to go through the Uniswap governance process for a V3 license approval.\n\nIf approved, ICHI will deploy Uniswap v3 on Evmos along with the ICHI Vault smart contracts. This will bring trusted name brand protocols and more capital efficient liquidity to Evmos to improve user experience.\n\nAbstract\n\nUniswap is the premier AMM in the DeFi world, and has become the most forked protocols in the industry with a large number of protocols forking their V2. V3 has added the ability for concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers making Uniswap the most flexible and efficient AMM ever designed. The Evmos community has the opportunity to acquire permission for a name brand deployment of Uniswap V3 that the larger Cosmos community will be able to take advantage of.\n\nICHI’s Vaults simplify the experience of using Uniswap for communities and enable the best crypto projects to create necessary liquidity without having to sell their tokens. With Vaults, projects can build deep, project-owned token liquidity while allowing token HODLers to earn fees without managing their pool positions. ICHI provides the infrastructure crypto projects need to build sustainable liquidity in a decentralized world and enables communities to create liquidity programs that drive value back to those who rely on them.\n\nWe have two possible routes to bring V3 to Evmos:\n\nGo through the Uniswap governance process to be granted permission for the V3 license use, fork their AMM code, and deploy to Evmos.\n\nPros: exposure of Evmos directly on the Uniswap v3 UI (brand recognition)\n\nCons: 1-2 months of resources spent on Uniswap governance process to get a license that expires April 1st,\n\nPrior to this, we would need to work with the ICHI team to launch an Evmos vault on Ethereum. We would also need to signal commitment to boostraping native liquidity with incentives, and provide an amount of tokens that would be earmarked for the Uniswap grants program.\n\nWait until their business license expires on April 1st, at which time anyone can use the V3 codebase to fork their AMM code.\n\nPros: Minimal resources spent to get the code (leaving more time to prepare for the launch)\n\nCons: No definite exposure to Uniswap v3 UI (brand recognition)\n\nMotivation\n\nEvmos DeFi has seen its ups and downs through the Nomad incident as well as the current environment following the FTX debacle. It is great to see we still have teams eager to build and deploy, but we are missing a blue chip or name brand DeFi protocol on Evmos. Having Ethermint and the EVM gives us a leg up and provides an identical environment that some of the most battle tested and innovative protocols leverage on Ethereum.\n\nA deployment of Uniswap V3 would become a cornerstone for Evmos DeFi, and rival any other AMM that would seek to deploy in the Cosmos. The upcoming protocols and future innovators need strong DeFi primitives to leverage when building. Uniswap V3 would be a top tier cornerstone in Evmos DeFi for builders to take advantage of and create new and exciting features in the Interchain realm.\n\nICHI Foundation Intro\n\nThe ICHI project was launched in November 2020 with the Branded Dollar protocol. In 2021 the second protocol, Vaults, was launched in July to enable simplified liquidity provision for token projects on top of Uniswap v3 on Ethereum mainnet. Since then the project has branched out to Polygon, received grants from Flow, Moonbeam, and Solana, and has entered a partnership with Boba to develop Uniswap v3 in their ecosystem. The ICHI team has members that hail from both big tech (Amazon, IBM, Redhat, Microsoft) and native crypto builders (Flow, Hedera Hashgraph).

In 2021 the second protocol, Vaults, was launched in July to enable simplified liquidity provision for token projects on top of Uniswap v3 on Ethereum mainnet. Since then the project has branched out to Polygon, received grants from Flow, Moonbeam, and Solana, and has entered a partnership with Boba to develop Uniswap v3 in their ecosystem.

%5D%7D","plaintext":"Summary\n\nAs part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative with Regen Network, we would like to discuss bringing Evmos’s carbon emission to net zero (#EvmosZERO) by employing community spend funds to offset the protocol validator set.\n\nAuthors\n\nNemus | Stakecito ( @stakecito )\n\nGhazni | Stakecito ( @ghazni1010 )\n\nAbstract\n\nCommunity pool spend of 63,800 $EVMOS tokens to purchase and retire 6,380 Nature Carbon Ton from Osmosis DEX and an additional 212,666 $EVMOS token to purchase and retire 1,595 of City Forest Credits from Regen marketplace at app.regen.network, becoming a carbon neutral blockchain for the year 2022. In total (63,800 + 212,666 = 276,466 $EVMOS)\n\nMotivation\n\nThe environmental cost of blockchain technology is often cited as a problem that needs to be tackled before widespread adoption. Proof of Work consensus algorithms, such as those in use by Bitcoin, create an arms race of computing power in order for a miner to be the first to create a new block and so obtain the reward.\n\nCosmos’ Proof of Stake validation system drastically improves on this by making this competition take place over attracting more delegation of stake from users. Validators are not required to perform deliberately complicated calculations and so can run on relatively low power machines. However, these machines are still required to be online 24/7 and perform calculations to confirm each block as it is generated. This results in a carbon footprint for each blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nBased on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Evmos is estimated to emit at most 7975 tons (= 7975 NCT) a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate. Thanks to new innovations from the Regen Network protocol, Cosmos ecosystem blockchains have the opportunity to offset carbon emissions directly within the ecosystem.\n\nRegen Network is a public proof-of-stake blockchain custom-built for global carbon accounting on the CosmosSDK. Regen’s infrastructure originates high-quality nature-based digital carbon in the Interchain economy, unlocking web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) and catalyzing solutions to the climate crisis.\n\n#EvmosZERO - more than carbon neutrality\n\nWhy is this relevant for Evmos and where is the opportunity? Carbon credits are financial assets that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. The race is on!\n\nSome of the major Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based Layer-1 protocols, such as Polygon , offset their carbon emission by retiring $400,000 in carbon credits (104,794 tonnes) on KlimaDAO, a Polygon based ReFi market inspired by OlympusDAO. The decision came after Polygon’s $20 Million pledge to become carbon negative in 2022.\n\nCelo , another EVM Layer-1, went a step further and is not only carbon negative by offsetting on Wren, but it is increasingly becoming the EVM-hub for ReFi by actively investing in projects and collaborating with existing players such as Toucan Protocol on Polygon and Regen Network on Cosmos.\n\nEvmos could position itself as one of the major ReFi-hubs for EVM-based projects by investing early into ReFi projects, which could spin off into its own grants category. Those that deploy on Evmos will eventually have the desire to do cross-chain transactions with other EVMs as well as access the Cosmos ecosystem via Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).\n\nAs a first step, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022. Evmos has its roots in Cosmos ( Cosmos Hub prop 44 ) and this would demonstrate to users, builders, investors, and all involved stakeholders in the space that strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem are possible (more in the section “Out co-operating the competition: an opportunity for Evmos & Regen”).\n\nCosmos ZERO, a partnership of Regen Network and the Interchain Foundation, is an initiative for Cosmos protocols and validators to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for their network validator node infrastructure and operations. Together, the Cosmos-based blockchain community can scale our action to meet the urgency of climate change.\n\nCosmos ZERO Program:\n\nhttps://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10\n\nCosmos ZERO Carbon Footprint Analysis:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA/edit\n\nCosmos ZERO FAQs:\n\nhttps://regennetwork.notion.site/FAQ-7e738366e1ee428084838355ec1b6e8a\n\nAll calculations consider flight miles, offices, virtual CPUs, physical data centers, and location-based emissions factors for validator operations. *The “worst case scenario” carbon footprint was established based on a sampling taken of Regen Network’s own validators. The largest validator operation of the set emitted 25 tons of carbon per year, according to the PoS Carbon Calculator with their data applied. This standard is used to avoid underestimations.\n\nOut co-operating the competition: an opportunity for Evmos & Regen!\n\nEvmos is built using Cosmos SDK as a high-throughput PoS Tendermint chain and it is interoperable with the Cosmos ecosystem through the IBC, which naturally aligns well with Regen Network. Also, Evmos offers all the capabilities of Ethereum, Celo, or any other EVM-compatible chain. This is where Regen can be complementary, providing knowledge and resources to enable ReFi on the Evmos.\n\nWhat is the advantage for Evmos to partner and offset with Regen?\n\nRegen Network is the leading ReFi project in the Cosmos ecosystem\n\nSeveral Cosmos projects such as Osmosis, IXO and CHEQD have committed through governance to offset their carbon emission & Stargaze already retired their carbon emission on Regen Network\n\nVarious other Cosmos projects have ongoing governance discussions to offset on Regen as well (e.g. Cosmos Hub, Juno, Gravity Bridge, Akash, Agoric, Injective, Regen, Empower)\n\nMany validators have joined the Cosmos ZERO initiative and are actively engaging with other projects and communities\n\nRegen Network is well connected among the ReFi communities in other ecosystems such as Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, Solana, and co.\n\nWhat are some of the potential synergies between Evmos & Regen that could be addressed in future proposals?\n\nAdd $EVMOS to the allowed currency list for Regen Network\n\nBring NCTs and CFCs as ERC-20 to Evmos\n\nLaunch $EVMOS/$NCT pools on Evmos dexes (e.g. Diffusion)\n\nHelp the Evmos validator set to improve the climate impact of their node infrastructure and thereby reduce the carbon footprint\n\nRegen helped Evmos to push ReFi projects such as Gitcoin, supporting this on the Gitcoin end for many years\n\nEvmos could start where the most traction and product-market fit is and evolve from there. It’s obvious, that Evmos currently has strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem which it can build upon:\n\n$EVMOS highest volume is on Osmosis: volume & liquidity for EVMOS/OSMO pair is always in the top 10\n\nHuge portion of $EVMOS airdrop was claimed by Cosmonauts\n\nCosmos Hub funded Ethermint and thereby made Evmos possible\n\nCosmonauts are Evmos’s largest and oldest user base\n\nOffsetting on Regen is just the first step in this mutual partnership.\n\nOffsetting Evmos’s carbon footprint on Regen Network\n\nOne carbon credit (e.g. Nature Carbon Ton / NCT or City Forest Credits / CFC) is equivalent to one metric ton of carbon emission. Regen Network offers Cosmos protocols two options for offsetting carbon emissions directly within the ecosystem.\n\nOption #1: Purchase Nature Carbon Ton - NCT:\n\nRegen Network is launching Nature Carbon Ton credits (NCT) , a premium digital carbon basket of nature-based projects in cooperation with the Osmosis decentralized exchange. NCT is issued by the major legacy web2 registry, Verra , and tokenized onto the blockchain.\n\nCredit standards follow the Verra Verified Carbon Unit program, and include regular monitoring and 3rd party outcome verification before credits are issued. These credits follow existing institutional carbon credit standards. NCT-eligible eco credits must also adhere to a 10-year rolling acceptance window, updated annually with the calendar to ensure that the pool quality remains high.\n\nFurthermore, NCT is a fungible, IBC-compatible carbon basket backed by nature-based carbon credits that have verifiable ecological, social, and economic benefits issued onto the Regen blockchain. It can be used as a carbon offset and retired on chain by reversing a basket token and retiring it in the on-chain registry on Regen Ledger.\n\nIn order to provide sufficient liquidity for any Cosmos chain or validator to choose to offset their project for multiple years, Osmosis and Regen Network will co-own NCT liquidity, establishing NCT:$Regen and NCT:Osmo pools.\n\nOriginal osmosis governance proposal: https://commonwealth.im/osmosis/discussion/3936-proposal-osmosis-carbon-market-with-regen-network\n\nOnce the non-custodial bridge from Polygon to Regen Ledger is completed, these pools will launch, offering not only the opportunity for protocol offsetting via NCT on Osmosis, but protocol liquidity rewards mining. Estimates assume that one NCT will be around $3 - $4 per NCT upon launch on Osmosis, which is targeted for Q1 2023.\n\nOption #2: City Forest Credits - CFC:\n\nCity Forest Credits (CFC) on Regen Marketplace are issued by the City Forest Credits Registry, follow the requirements of the Urban Forest Carbon Credit Class, and are tokenized onto the blockchain.\n\nCFCs feature carbon credits (or rather eco credits) that have verifiable ecological, social, and economic benefits issued onto the Regen Ledger blockchain. These credits follow the CFC standards and require regular monitoring and 3rd party outcome verification before credits are issued. These credits follow existing institutional carbon credit standards.\n\nEco Credits from Sandy Cross, Harvey Manning , and Buena Vista Heights can be purchased in Regen Network’s native coin $REGEN, $EEUR, or $USDC bridged with Axelar or Gravity Bridge. Eco Credits are judged to be of a higher standard with additional co-benefits (than NCTs) and therefore fetch a higher price. CFCs are offered between 30$ and $40 per carbon credit on the Regen marketplace.\n\nProposal Details\n\nWe propose that Evmos acquire a mixture of 80% Nature Carbon Ton (NCT) via Osmosis DEX and 20% City Forest Credits (CFC) available in the Regen Marketplace, to offset its carbon emission and become carbon neutral for 2022. NCT is estimated to cost approximately $3 per metric ton on Osmosis at launch. CFC currently sells for $40 per metric ton on Regen. With Evmos’s worst-case carbon emissions projections, this would include 6,380 tons to offset with NCT and 1,595 tons to offset with CFC for the period of 1 year (2022). We will take a lower bound price of 0.3$ per EVMOS for calculating the offset.\n\nAny unspent $EVMOS will be returned to the Evmos community pool.\n\nVoting YES to this proposal indicates approval to offset Evmos’s carbon emissions by spending 63,800 $EVMOS tokens from the community pool to purchase 6,380 Nature Carbon Ton (= USD $19,140 at USD $3 a credit) and spending 212,666 $EVMOS tokens from the community pool to purchase 1,595 of City Forest Credits (USD $63,800 at USD $40 a credit).\n\nVoting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated and the proposal has to be adjusted.\n\nTO BE DISCUSSED\n\nAccounts to fund and control carbon credit purchase and offset process needs to be clarified.\n\nTwo EVMOS members to join a REGEN member on a multi-sig account need to be decided. Stakecito team would volunteer to be a member of the multi-sig.\n\nWhether an annual protocol commitment to purchase additional carbon credits to maintain carbon neutrality going forward is wished.\n\nCommunity poll whether testnet should be included.\n\nTarget on-chain date.

Proof of Work consensus algorithms, such as those in use by Bitcoin, create an arms race of computing power in order for a miner to be the first to create a new block and so obtain the reward.\\\\n\\\\nCosmos’ Proof of Stake validation system drastically improves on this by making this competition take place over attracting more delegation of stake from users. Validators are not required to perform deliberately complicated calculations and so can run on relatively low power machines. However, these machines are still required to be online 24/7 and perform calculations to confirm each block as it is generated. This results in a carbon footprint for each blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nBased on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Evmos is estimated to emit at most \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://regennetwork.notion.site/Calculate-a-Protocol-Carbon-Footprint-506bcfd032c248c6a5c3bb2734dc7105\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"7975 tons (= 7975 NCT)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate.

Evmosians!\n\nThis is spacefi.io team. Since Kickstart DeFi on Evmos launched 2 months ago, Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem has shown encouraging growth. At the same time, we also are experiencing some difficulties, both in the overall crypto market and in the Evmos ecosystem building. As a project that has been building with innovation from Evmos testnet until now, SpaceFi shares the community's passion for Evmos in spite of the tough environment. Now we are planning to introduce Evmos Liquidity Incentive to SpaceFi and help Evmos liquidity and ecosystem to grow further through the launch of SpaceFi entire products suite as well as the SPACE token.\n\n(Space DEX and NFT are already live on Evmos mainnet. The full launching will include Farm+Spacebase+Launchpad)\n\nWe ever released a pre-proposal about Bridges competition and Bootstrap Evmos liquidity in September. after hearing some feedbacks from community, we’ve temporarily postponed the proposal to observe how Liquidity Incentive works on Diffusion. Since then, we have now prepared a new proposal. If you didn't know about SpaceFi before, you can try: www.spacefi.io\n\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we'll rename SpaceFi token STAR to SPACE to distinguish it from Stargaze.\n\nWhy Evmos Liquidity Incentive?\n\n1. Evmos native liquidity is still very small and further improvement of liquidity is a priority. Meanwhile, we can promote the ecosystem as soon as possible. We're proposing some new measures to solve problems in the previous liquidity incentive.\n\n2. The amount of Evmos Liquidity Incentive seems large, but is much smaller compared to the high inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating (about 0.438M EVMOS/day) . The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself. If Evmos liquidity and ecosystem can't be improved soon, the selling of Evmos delegating rewards will bring more pressure than before.\n\n3. This proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching. We hope to bring more use cases for Evmos and more confidence to the ecosystem and community through SpaceFi's performance.\n\n4. The previous Liquidity Incentive on Diffusion will run out on 2023.01.19. We need to develop a strategy to maintain and enhance the native liquidity.\n\nAbstract\n\nSince Evmos Liquidity Incentive was first launched on Diffusion, the TVL on it has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M. During the process, we have found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value. As the previous Evmos Liquidity Incentive program on Diffusion will end on 2023.01.19, we’d like to suggest a rough plan, to improve Evmos liquidity and ecosystem.\n\n1. Concentrated liquidity\n\nAlthough Evmos has $2.5 million in native liquidity, it is mainly split into 13 trading pairs. And the largest one, EVMOS-ATOM, currently has only $750k (2023.01.18). The fragmentation and low liquidity has prevented many ecosystem projects from functioning properly.\n\nGiven the data of liquidity & trading volume of each bridge asset during the Kickstart DeFi on Evmos process, we recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity. When Evmos liquidity improves, the incentive of multiple bridge assets and trading pairs can be considered again.\n\nTo solve the fragmentation, Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom created their official bridges in the early stage of the ecosystem. All assets from third-party bridges should be converted to official bridge assets. This can also be achieved with a trustworthy third-party bridge.\n\nThere are also suggestions from the community for SpaceFi to incentivize other IBC assets and some mainstream assets such as wBNB, BUSD, etc. to differentiate our incentive program from Diffusion's. We totally understand. However, we are concerned that this may lead to more fragmented liquidity. From the experience of Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom ecosystem, different DEXs choose to incentivize similar primary liquidity, and through competition, the liquidity will eventually concentrate on the DEXs that are more beneficial to the ecosystem.\n\nIn response to the choices of whether to focus on a single bridge and incentivized assets, we hope to understand community’s feedback through additional polls.\n\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge and ATOM / USDC / wETH / OSMO / wBTC / JUNO / SPACE as the incentivized assets to concentrate liquidity. More bridges and assets can be added after the effective growth of liquidity. At that time, we will communicate with the community in advance. (updated on 2023.01.10)\n\n2. LP Bonding\n\nTo incentivize long-term liquidity providers and to avoid the adverse effects of mercenary liquidity, SpaceFi Farm supports LP Bonding, including no bonding, 7 days unbonding and 14 days unbonding. The longer the locked LP in farm, the higher the APR will be.  You can take a glance at LP Bonding, which is being tested internally.\n\n(image)\n\n3. Ecosystem Building\n\nEvmos Liquidity Incentive is a short-term booster. And the thriving ecosystem projects are the long-term value. SpaceFi has been actively helping projects get started in Evmos through incubation and launchpad.\n\nOur first incubated project, Soul Network , a cross-chain DID network and unified activities portal in Cosmos & Ethereum, based on Evmos, won first place in the Web3 track at the Evmos Momentum Hackathon. Soul Network has supported cross-chain Mint NFT and started serving the entire Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, we are also are in communication with three gaming teams for Evmos ecosystem cooperation to introduce more potential new projects.\n\nSoul Network   | SpaceFi Launchpad Program\n\nAmount of Funds Requested\n\nAccording to the community's feedbacks, we plan to apply for 2 M 1M EVMOS as liquidity incentive to start, in a program lasting 90 days, and expect to bring $4-$8 M of native liquidity to Evmos with an APR of 57%-114% 37% (no bonding)-73% (14 days unbonding), similar to it on Osmosis, or $8-$16 M of native liquidity with an ARP 34%-67% . The above is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18. If the liquidity grows well, we'll apply to increase the incentive for the further growth.\n\nAs the community pool has granted a round of 2 M EVMOS liquidity incentive on Diffusion which may end on January 19, 2023, there may be concerns about the requested amount of incentives given the current market. However, if the APR is low, it may not be attractive enough for users and liquidity. In fact, 2M 1M EVMOS is about 2 days' inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating (about 0.438M EVMOS/day). We offer two options up for discussion.\n\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly, to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping. We can also provide xEVMOS module as a public good for other incentive programs if needed. (2023.01.10)\n\nThe liquidity incentive can last more than 90 days if some users choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately with 50% EVMOS transferred back. The other 50% EVMOS of the above will help the incentive run longer.\n\nIf the liquidity growth hits a bottleneck, we will consider increasing other incentivized assets to achieve further growth, or reducing the planned incentives to make the incentive last longer, or other flexible responses. (2023.01.10)\n\nPlan A: Use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly\n\nWe believe the underlying reason for concern is that community want the incentives to be more effective in delivering real value, rather than just dumping. We are developing the xEVMOS module to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping.\n\nStep 1: We plan to launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, converted 1:1 from EVMOS. xEVMOS earned from liquidity incentive can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30 days unbonding period. You can also choose to unbond immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS.\n\nStep 2:  The other 50% EVMOS of immediate unbonding will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.\n\nWith xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. In Plan A, the actual duration of the incentive can last over 90 days. You can take a glance at xEVMOS module, which is in the internal testing.\n\n(image)\n\nPlan B: Use EVMOS directly as the reward\n\nIf community would like to use Evmos directly as the reward, we hope to get feedback on the requested amount of incentive through a poll.\n\nFund Utilization Plan\n\nWe divide the pairs into MAJOR, STABLE, and MINOR categories, borrowing from the incentive allocation in Kickstart DeFi on Evmos proposal by benny lava and other Evmos Governance members. The initial rewards are allocated as follows:\n\nMAJOR: 50%, 5555 EVMOS / day + 29165 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / ATOM - total 250k EVMOS + 1312380 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / ETH - total 175k EVMOS + 918720 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / BTC - total 125k EVMOS + 393750 SPACE\n\nSTABLE: 35%, 3888 EVMOS / day + 20414 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / USDC - total 350k EVMOS + 1837260 SPACE\n\nMINOR: 15%, 1666 EVMOS / day + 8754 SPACE / day\n\nEVMOS / OSMO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / JUNO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / SPACE - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nThe reward weight for each pair can be adjusted each two weeks based on liquidity & volume data.\n\nTVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 146% (no bonding) - 293% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 73% (no bonding) - 146% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 4M-8M, APR 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding)\n\nThe above TVL and APR is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18.\n\nCheck Detailed Chart\n\n(image)\n\n1. For LP Bonding, we tentatively set the APR for 14 days unbonding to 2 times that of 0 days unbonding to incentivize more and longer lasting LP Bonding to keep Evmos liquidity stable.\n\n2. The above TVL and APR data are calculated based on 2  1M EVMOS rewards, if xEVMOS plan is used, it is possible to increase the APR or make the incentive last longer.\n\nThis is not just another proposal for Liquidity Incentive\n\nSpaceFi is a community project with no VC funding, and has been building in EVMOS ecosystem since February 2022 at our own expense. We want to make it an engine in the ecosystem, not just a DEX. So the whole SpaceFi product includes modules like DEX+Farm+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad, and we are continuously developing innovative features.\n\nThis proposal is not only about EVMOS Liquidity Incentive, but also about the official launching of SpaceFi, a new effort by EVMOS community and ecosystem. At the same time as the EVMOS Liquidity Incentive begins, we will be fully launch the SpaceFi product and SPACE token, hopefully bringing new energy and confidence to EVMOS ecosystem and community.\n\nThe initial emission of SPACE token will be about 250,000 125,000 SPACE / day, 70% of which will be used for farming rewards, i.e. 175,000 87,500 SPACE /day. We will allocate 2/3 of the SPACE farming reward to EVMOS Liquidity Incentive, i.e. 116,700 58,350 SPACE /day. The remaining 1/3 will be allocated to SPACE & Planet NFT staking and other liquidity incentives.\n\nSpaceFi Highlight:\n\nSpace Swap:  Forked Uniswap V2. Also, we are working on an liquidity concentration solution based on Algebra.finance, similar to Uniswap V3, which has been integrated on Polygon's #1 DEX QuickSwap.\n\nSpace Farm:  Includes single pools, LP pools, NFT pools, and supports LP Bonding.\n\nPlanet NFT:  Burn SPACE to mint different levels of Planet NFT, for staking reward, bonus and governance.\n\nSpacebase:  On-chain community, created by burning SPACE. The creator can invite members to join, and both parties will receive an additional 5% of the member's farming reward. Based on Spacebase, team farming competitions and trading contests are also available.\n\nLaunchpad:  Supports for new project funding, with Public/Private pools and Token Vesting. we have released the Launchpad Program to help new projects launch on Evmos, and can provide multiple liquidity rewards to support.\n\nSpace Swap and Planet NFT are already live on Evmos mainnet.\n\nSpace Swap has been running since May 2022 to date. There are over 2,000 early adopters providing liquidity in Space Swap, but overall liquidity is currently low due to the SPACE and EVMOS incentives are not enabled before. We believe that Space Swap can provide more liquidity to EVMOS ecosystem as liquidity incentives begin. Try Space Swap on Evmos mainnet\n\nPlanet NFT is the Pass of SpaceFi ecosystem, early minting has been finished on EVMOS mainnet and is currently the second largest market cap NFT in EVMOS ecosystem. We believe that Planet NFT minting and trading volume will further increase as SPACE token and NFT staking launching. Check Planet NFT on Orbit Market\n\nIf this proposal is passed, what will happen next?\n\n1. Space Farm, NFT Staking/Marketplace, Spacebase, Launchpad modules will be launched on EVMOS mainnet. (within 1 month)\n\n2. SPACE Token launching and Evmos Liquidity Incentive begins. ( the 1st week, trial run )\n\n3. SPACE Token and EVMOS Liquidity Incentive fully runs. Genesis Spacebase event will be launched. (the 2nd week )\n\n4. Spacebase farming reward PK competition. ( 3rd-5th week )\n\n5. SpaceFi trading contest. ( 7th-9th week )\n\n6. As liquidity grows, we will consider helping new projects to launch on Evmos through Launchpad, possibly Soul Network or others. (TBD)\n\nSpacebase is an on-chain community, created by burning STAR. The creator can invite members to join, and both parties will receive an additional 5% of the member's farming reward. There'll be TVL data and minining reward data in each spacebase, where we can launch PK events to make it gamified.

Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.\n\nThe Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.\n\n## The Public Goods Created\n\n[22 Feb - 21 March 2022: ~359.5h](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md)\n\n### Ethermint: ~100h\n\n- AnteHandler - GasMeter with unenforced gasWanted limit, to be used for bounding block gas in the block proposal phase [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/964](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/964) (reading docs, implementing, debugging - 55h)\n- eth_feeHistory - fix reward calculation [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/990](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/990) after 2 quick fixes ([https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/970](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/970), [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/975](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/975)) - trying to reproduce the issue ([https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13649#issuecomment-1067953572](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13649#issuecomment-1067953572), [https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13874#issuecomment-1067390401](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/13874#issuecomment-1067390401)), sync mainnet/testnet nodes, implement fix, write issues, help document postmortem - 45h\n\n### Integration Testing for Evmos Vesting Module: ~30h\n\n[https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317/commits/2f3682d63906d11eb764f40d83928345465f30ad](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317/commits/2f3682d63906d11eb764f40d83928345465f30ad)\n\nI have discovered the following implementations that did not conform with the intent (bug):\n- vested but unlocked coins were allowed to be delegated - [https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/286#pullrequestreview-893077040](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/286#pullrequestreview-893077040)\n- clawback before unlock would also clawback vested coins\n\n### Integration Testing for Evmos Claims Module: ~55h\n\n[https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/373](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/373)\n\n### PR Reviews: ~3h\n\n- [https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/935](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/935)\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/953\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/968\n- https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/pull/991\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/317\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/339\n- https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/pull/360\n\n### JS notebooks for testing: 8h\n\nScript for sending multiple transactions to evmos with random gas prices/fees, or testing Metamask: [https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-stress-test](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-stress-test)\nPlayground for testing evmosjs libs: [https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-js](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evmos-js).\n\n\n### Evmos Core Team Calls\n\nPresence in calls: 9*0.5 + 1 * 2 = 6.5h\n\n### Other tasks for Evmos: 5h\n\n- [my moral take on Evmos launch and upgrade fail](https://github.com/the-laurel/governance/blob/main/docs/EthicsOfBlockchainGovernance.md): 3h\n- the present document: 2h\n\n### Video Demos of What can be built on Evmos\n\n(the ideas presented in the videos are the intellectual property of The Laurel Project and are outside the scope of this proposal)\n\n#### EVM interpreter precompile (demoed on an Evmos fork): 43h\n\n- video Feb 26, 2022: [https://youtu.be/uzc1ijYhZE8](https://youtu.be/uzc1ijYhZE8)\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\n- precompile programming: 36h\n- dapp: 3h\n\n\n#### EVM Interpreter Precompile used as a Trustworthy Compute Engine (with a spreadsheet engine): 33h\n\n- video Mar 5, 2022: [https://youtu.be/kHDxDiM5xvQ](https://youtu.be/kHDxDiM5xvQ)\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\n- precompile programming: 20h\n- dapp: 9h\n\n#### Generalized Replay Bridge with Ethereum VM, IBC (Cosmos) & Evmos: 49h\n\n- video Mar 13, 2022: [https://youtu.be/ayFzY4btFX4](https://youtu.be/ayFzY4btFX4)\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 5h\n- precompile programming: 40h\n- dapp: 4h\n\n#### Gas Refill Precompile - Prepay Ethereum VM transactions: 27h\n\n- video Mar 19, 2022: [https://youtu.be/S9HLBwG6Ifo](https://youtu.be/S9HLBwG6Ifo)\n- video script, recording, editing, publishing: 4h\n- precompile programming: 20h\n- dapp: 3h\n\n\n## Proofs\n\n* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.\n* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.\n* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Federico Kunze signed the confirmations for the effort, as a comment on [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2). The exact text was:\n> I confirm and acknowledge the stated output.

The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).\n\n## Retroactive Payment\n\n359.5h * 255 euro/h = 91,672.5 eur\n\n\n## The Meaning of the Decision\n\n* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.\n* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort in perpetuity. \n* 3. No with veto: the chain benefits from and uses this free, unpaid effort, but it has decided to punish the author of this effort, for asking for formal recognition of the volunteered effort.\n\n## Receiver Address\n\nevmos1k9pw7ht4kp7td5450sdrkj2tmly3ug59ddhadn\n\n\n## Author\n\nLoredana Cirstea, volunteer for The Laurel Project.\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Voting","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-21T21:47:32.021Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos17ucx8wx9mz9f2a4ccum536gthydprcumuchveh\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Loredana\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Volunteer from The Laurel Project.

Club’s Evmos Grants Proposal\n\nI. Summary\n\nEncode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps.\n\nEncode Club will organise a pilot grants programme for the Evmos community for H1 2023 (Jan to July). Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the DAO.\n\nRegular community calls shall be established and kept open to both the community and the DAO, which are to be used for questions, feedback and general updates about the programme’s progress. Additionally, 3 special check-in calls will be scheduled and executed throughout the programme - one following the successful setup of the grants programme, one midway through and one at the very end, the purpose of which is for Encode to provide further insight regarding grant applications and subsequently grantees.\n\nEncode Club is requesting $2-5MM in total to award to the best builders and projects for the duration of the programme. Allocated funds are to be kept in the Multisig controlled by the Evmos community and distributed only when needed by Encode via multisig composed of trusted community advisory members. Encode’s monthly expenses for running the programme will be $50k, which can be considered as part of the total requested grants amount as per the DAO’s preference.\n\nII. Encode Club\n\nEncode is one of the most trusted and well known companies within the web3 space, known for delivery of top tier programmes in partnership with the biggest names in the industry. Over the past two years their team has managed to successfully execute more than 90 events (both online and in-person).\n\nThe following are examples of the wide array of events conceptualised, marketed, organised and executed solely by the Encode team:\n\n 1.

Secret Sauce\n\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are the means by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\n\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse. Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\n\nEnsuring and maintaining the level of talent is a continuous task. The following are some of the implemented techniques and approaches that keeps the talent bar high and rising.\n\n1. Sourcing\n\nA significant amount of time and work is invested in making sure the best developers within a given ecosystem are both identified and made aware of an upcoming programme. To achieve this, the Encode team is keeping a close eye on every single event within the web3 space and tries to identify promising teams and projects alike. Getting in touch with them and inviting them to our own programme where they’ll be given a stage to perform and compete for great prizes is a priority. Furthermore, Encode Club is in direct communication with the majority of university blockchain clubs in existence around the world. Ensuring a close and warm bond with these societies contributes to a constant talent inflow for all Encode programmes.\n\n2. Education\n\nEncode’s focus on education and making sure it is as accessible as possible to the general web3 community has proven to be a very successful talent and attention acquisition strategy. All of the Encode Club programmes are built on a solid educational element which is taught by either Encode’s in-house teachers or by designated representatives from the project supporting Encode’s initiatives. The result of these sessions, workshops and lessons is then a solid knowledge base and a foundation for developers and programme participants to build upon.\n\n 3. Support\n\nManaging the talent within a programme and making sure participants are engaged and motivated to give their best is something Encode manages to achieve by dedicating manpower towers supporting everyone taking part in their programmes. Multiple programme managers usually spend the majority of their time on keeping in touch with the hackers as well as making sure to schedule several one-on-one calls that help hackers voice concerns, point out specific needs and generally provide more feedback. This technique of constant engagement has proven key to maintaining high levels of active programme participants which then leads to a subsequent high levels of project submissions as well.\n\n 4. Reporting\n\nAnother key point that differentiates Encode Club from their competitors is the neverending attention to detail and data-driven approach which is at the core of all of their activities. Encode partners get to benefit from this, by leveraging pre-existing information on talent taking part of their programmes, identifying the best participants and even directly engaging with them. This approach allows for spotting top hackers and systematically pinpoint top performers even if their current work is their very first engagement with a specific ecosystem.\n\n 5. Engagement\n\nFinishing a programme is anything but the end for a hacker’s journey when it comes to their Encode experience. Encode will make sure to go the extra mile for all participants that have shown exceptional skills and dedication throughout a programme and make sure to follow up and provide support throughout these builders’ web3 journeys. Such may include, but not limited to - introductions to other prominent members of the Encode developer community, providing feedback for future projects, as well as facilitating intros to potential investors.\n\nIV. Proposal\n\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants programme that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\n\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the programme that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the DAO.\n\nEncode is to be allocated $2-5MM for the duration of the grants programme. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards. Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the programme.\n\nV. Reasoning\n\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programmes that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\n\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running Saddle’s successful grants programme , their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a programme of this magnitude.\n\nVI. Past Experience\n\nThe last time Encode was entrusted with running a grant programme was during the early months of 2022 when Saddle delegated the responsibility for running several editions of these to the Encode team. The two installments of the programme proved to be very successful and the young project managed to engage hundreds of developers to explore, build and contribute to their project.\n\n 1. Delegation\n\nEncode shines most prominently when entrusted with handling as many of the intricacies of a given programme as possible. Once general deliverables and goals were outlined by both parties, Encode was then allowed to lead the rest of the programme on its own with regular check-ins and update calls added to the diary in advance. This led to programme specific decisions to be made within Encode based on their team’s expertise, while keeping the sponsors with a hand on the wheel regarding the general direction of the programme itself.\n\n 2. Preparation\n\nMultiple calls were done by both parties in order to properly identify the needs of the sponsor and the extent to which Encode can adjust in order to meet them. The results were carefully crafted tracks of challenges (both technical and non-technical) that were to serve as a guiding point for developers and enthusiasts alike to try and conquer. Example of such were:\n\nTechnical Bounties\n\nFork Saddle code to bring stablecoin swaps to alt chains\n\nApplications and integrations built with/on top of Saddle\n\nStaking functionality on Saddle dApp\n\ndApp dashboard for Saddle LPs\n\nAnalytics for Saddle protocol and pools\n\nNon-technical Bounties\n\nUsability research and user testing\n\nSaddle swag mockups\n\nMemes\n\nSaddle-inspired NFT art\n\nAMAs with your favourite crypto communities\n\nThe challenges proved to be a great mix of both accessible and hard to accomplish, which led to great levels of engagement from both within and outside the Encode community.\n\n 3. Execution\n\nSeries of events were outlined from the get go to keep the public informed and engaged with the developments around the grants programme. With all of them being live, participants had the opportunity to directly engage with both the Saddle and Encode team, ask questions and get support for their projects.\n\nAdditional educational events were included, hosted by Encode with speakers from Saddle, that would provide further depth to the bounties and a proper way to tackle them in a way that would lead to a successful grant allocation. These sessions proved key for keeping the community’s attention high and up-to-date with all latest developments.\n\nLastly, dedicated highlight events were introduced to serve as a show-and-tell for developers and builders, where they would get the chance to present their work in front of the grants team and eventually compete for one. Those event ended up as a fantastic opportunity for grant participants to compare their work and receive constructive feedback from the Saddle team.\n\n 4. Evaluations\n\nOnce the first batch of grants were distributed, the Encode team went through a vigorous evaluation process with the Saddle team. The purpose of this was to maintain a close connection with their team as well as make sure their goals were being met accordingly and standard of the programme and its execution would meet their high expectations.\n\nVII. Success Stories\n\nHaving organised so many successful programmes over the past several years, Encode is proud to have witnessed multiple great stories of hard work, true dedication and subsequent great success. The following are just a few of projects that came to exist through Encode and went on to conquer the heights of the web3 space.\n\n 1. 0xmons\n\nA winner of one of Encode Club’s 2021 hackathons. Known for their distinctive pixel images generated by a GAN, the project proved to be one of the most valuable and well recognized projects of the NFT space even prior to the great boom and NFT movement later that year. Their founder went on to later build a side project, which resulted in being one of the biggest decentralised NFT marketplaces - Sudoswap .\n\n 2. Float Protocol\n\nA hackathon finalist from 2021, Float Protocol stood out with its innovative protocol design for a fully decentralised and non-dollar pegged stablecoin. Challenging the norm of dollar-pegged stablecoins at the time resulted in the protocol capturing the attention of the majority of the DeFi space, which led to the protocol amassing an excess of 1 billion in total value locked upon launch. Their success was soon followed by an investment by DeFi allstars like Stani Kulechov, 0xMaki, MCV and the LAO.\n\n 3. Footium\n\nAfter being selected among the best projects to take part in Encode’s Accelerator programme back in 2020, Footium ended up maturing into one of the finest and most promising NFT games within the space. Their hard work and commitment to creating the best football manager game in the web3 space was widely recognised and soon led to a successful investment led by the London-based VC firm BACKED, as well as others such as Animoca Brands, Stride.VC and YGG.\n\n 4. Euler Finance\n\nA 2020 participant from one of Encode’s earliest Hackathons, Euler was then crowned winner. Their innovative lending protocol idea went through a two-year long development journey, which saw the product finally getting released to the public in early 2022 and is currently being considered one of Aave and Compound’s direct and biggest competitors. Along the way, the team managed to catch the attention of some of the most prominent investors in the space and secure more than $40 million in investments led by Paradigm.\n\nVIII. Process\n\n 1. Outline\n\nEncode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:\n\nBrief summary and explanation\n\nClearly outlined deliverables\n\nExecution and delivery within the timeline of the programme\n\nAmount of funding attached\n\nThere will be two types of bounties:\n\nCompetitions – several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the programme.\n\nAward – a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the programme.\n\nBounties will be listed on the Encode website and public calls for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organise several education events with community members and investors from the Evmos community throughout the bounty period.\n\nTeams then engage in working, building and polishing their projects by the deadline outlined in the programme. The best are to be invited, judged and rewarded in proportion to their efforts and magnitude of impact for the Evmos ecosystem in a show and tell finale events organised by Encode.\n\n 2. Bounties\n\nBounties are to be outlined in advance with the help of both prominent community members as well as the input from the core Evmos team. Different bounties, challenges and tracks may be both added or subtracted throughout the duration of the programme based on the project submissions and subsequent reward allocations.\n\nIn order to properly involve the community, Encode shall create dedicated discord channels for the programme and aggregate all proposals before finalising a complete list of bounties and allocating a portion of the rewards pool for each.\n\n 3. Promotion\n\nEncode will rely heavily on their existing communication and social networking channels including Discord , Medium and Twitter . These have proven successful multiple times in the past by driving organic growth, word of mouth and interest in their programmes. Several representatives of the Encode team shall take care of engaging with prospective participants and work on generating interest towards the programme on a daily basis.\n\n 4. Execution\n\nThis is where Encode Club excels at - with multiple dedicated programme managers, their team can provide unmatched attention to detail and participant support in order to ensure continuous engagement and ensure developers end up fulfilling the potential of the projects and goals they’ve set to accomplish.\n\nDedicated 1-1 calls on a regular basis provide further insight into what teams are doing, what bounties they’re working on as well as the roadblocks they’re encountering. This information is crucial and addressing the team’s input and feedback in time guarantees higher participation numbers and increased submission rates.\n\n 5. Communication\n\nEncode Club will hold regular office hours within their discord for community members, builders and Evmos representatives to join for an unstructured discussion, allowing for people to ask questions, share opinions and voice concerns.\n\n 6. Rewards\n\nRewards will too follow the same pattern as the bounties, with each getting a reward range agreed in advance and subject to change depending on project submissions and allocation of rewards. Rewards will be initiated upon successfully covering the bounty requirements, with the prizes being distributed directly from the DAO treasury and approved by the committee multisig.\n\n 7. Hiring Support\n\nEncode Club is a talent hub and a hiring pipeline for many of its partners. As such, it has dedicated personnel working hard to identify talented individuals, help them fulfill their potential and eventually see them hired or start their own companies within the web3 space. Throughout the grants programme, our talent team will work closely with its participants to try and connect them with like-minded individuals, possessing the qualities they are looking for in order to elevate the level of the project they’re working on. Additionally, they’ll focus on highlighting the best builders to the Evmos team working on exploring employment options for them within the ecosystem.\n\n 8. Iteration\n\nEven though Encode has conducted multiple programmes like these in the past, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge that each of these vary in some respect based on a number of factors such as chain complexities, market conditions, programme-specific intricacies. Therefore, Encode Club shall actively monitor and take both the community’s and the Evmos’ team feedback into account and move swiftly to iterate where needed in order to meet the goals of the grants programme set off to achieve.\n\nIX. Evmos Committee\n\nIn order to ensure transparency and accountability on Encode Club’s side an Evmos Committee shall be formed with representatives from both the community and the Evmos team. It will be in direct communication with Encode and will have power to challenge their decisions along the way.\n\nFurthermore a multisig controlling the funds associated with the grants programme shall be formed that may or may not consist of the same members as the committee. The purpose of the multisig is to be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos.\n\nWith the help of the Evmos team, Encode Club will release a call to action to the Evmos community in an attempt to promote the chance to be on the Evmos committee and multisig for this programme. Exact execution and steps towards the creation of the committee will be finalised if the programme is to be approved from the DAO.\n\nX. Costs Breakdown\n\nFurthermore a multisig controlling the funds associated with the grants programme shall be formed that may or may not consist of the same members as the committee. The purpose of the multisig is to be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos.\n\nEncode is a 25 person team and will be putting significant effort across multiple departments and individuals. The following is a rough outline of the costs associated with the proper execution of the grants pilot programme.\n\nMarketing and Sourcing: $10k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nProgramme Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nGrant Team Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\nBook-keeping, Finances + Admin: $2.5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\nHiring support for any grantees: $5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\nTech and Infrastructure: $2.5k per month\n\nThis brings the total monthly cost of running the programme to $50k. The amount is to be invoiced in advance prior every month and deducted from the total grant size allocated for the program execution.\n\nXI. Conclusion\n\nEncode Club’s plan is to make this proposal available to the public for early evaluation and feedback by the end of December with the possibility of putting it to a vote in early January. If successful, Encode will be able to start executing as early as mid/late January.\n\nGathering bounty proposals from both the community and the Evmos team will begin immediately after approval. The marketing team will switch focus on promoting the grant programme, while also turning the attention of Encode’s existing Cosmos and Evmos hackers within the community to the upcoming event.\n\nGrant applicants will work closely with Encode Club’s programme managers throughout the duration of the program in order to ensure that their work follows the guidelines and meets the requirements outlined by the bounties in order to qualify for a grant. Encode will impose deadlines for project submissions, after which the best builders will be invited to present their work live and compete for a prize from the grants pool.\n\nEncode activities will remain under the constant supervision of the Evmos committee at all times and transactions will be executed via the trusted multisig.\n\nXII. FAQ\n\nThis is a big commitment/investment for the community - what happens if the quality of the projects submitted is not as high as the grants put aside for the programme?\n\nThe grants budget will never leave the Evmos Committee Multisig. It’s just a number that the DAO will be willing to deploy if the project submissions end up satisfying the requirements outlined by the programme. All unused funds will remain in the multisig and/or returned directly to the DAO for utilisation in other projects.\n\nWho is going to be controlling these funds?\n\nAn Evmos committee will be formed to govern the funds and approve expenditures. It will be composed (ideally) by prominent community members, trusted team members as well as validators.\n\nHow is the Evmos community going to be involved in this?\n\nThe Evmos community can help with providing ideas for structuring the grant programmes and help identifying key areas that should be addressed by the challenges. Additionally, certain representatives may be invited to join the governing body that will be overseeing the execution of the programme.\n\nWhy Encode and not someone else?\n\nEncode Club is one of the most experienced web3 education communities with a proven track record of successful high level execution of a wide range of programmes. With a numerous and strong chain-agnosting developer community they are an ideal candidate for a programme of the magnitude and importance of the Evmos grants.\n\nIs the programme going to a public one? How easy will it be for the community to follow or get involved?\n\nEncode Club will host regular public events for both informational and educational purposes, the purpose of which will be to help potential participants to get to know the best ways to become involved, submit a project and win a grant.\n\nWho gets to decide which projects get to receive grants?\n\nEncode club will rely on pre-defined and outlined criteria for picking grant winners. Once such are identified, they will be passed on to the Evmos committee along with the grants that Encode has suggested for allocation. If approved by the committee, the grants size will be deducted from the grants budget in the Committee Multisig.\n\nWhat happens to open grantees in the event of Encode’s programme not being renewed past the initial period?\n\nEncode Club will construct windows for grants being awarded such that if the programme is terminated after the initial 6 months, there will be no outstanding grants. For teams awarded within that 6 months, we will continue to provide support (unless asked otherwise) for a period of 3 months.","kind":"discussion","stage":"Voting","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-19T12:43:36.434Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1cz7nm0hfagxhxffvkp89amecpk2kpkxy2cu8vw\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Encode Club\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Web3 Education Community\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/7e8a4db8-29d2-4c1d-a8fd-39eb58bdf303.png\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-16T17:23:18.559Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Encode Club’s Evmos Grants Proposal\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"I.

Secret Sauce\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"the means\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\\\\n\\\\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse. Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\\\\n\\\\nEnsuring and maintaining the level of talent is a continuous task. The following are some of the implemented techniques and approaches that keeps the talent bar high and rising.\\\\n\\\\n             \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1. Sourcing\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nA significant amount of time and work is invested in making sure the best developers within a given ecosystem are both identified and made aware of an upcoming programme. To achieve this, the Encode team is keeping a close eye on every single event within the web3 space and tries to identify promising teams and projects alike. Getting in touch with them and inviting them to our own programme where they’ll be given a stage to perform and compete for great prizes is a priority. Furthermore, Encode Club is in direct communication with the majority of university blockchain clubs in existence around the world. Ensuring a close and warm bond with these societies contributes to a constant talent inflow for all Encode programmes. \\\\n\\\\n             \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"2. Education\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEncode’s focus on education and making sure it is as accessible as possible to the general web3 community has proven to be a very successful talent and attention acquisition strategy. All of the Encode Club programmes are built on a solid educational element which is taught by either Encode’s in-house teachers or by designated representatives from the project supporting Encode’s initiatives. The result of these sessions, workshops and lessons is then a solid knowledge base and a foundation for developers and programme participants to build upon.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             3. Support\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nManaging the talent within a programme and making sure participants are engaged and motivated to give their best is something Encode manages to achieve by dedicating manpower towers supporting everyone taking part in their programmes. Multiple programme managers usually spend the majority of their time on keeping in touch with the hackers as well as making sure to schedule several one-on-one calls that help hackers voice concerns, point out specific needs and generally provide more feedback. This technique of constant engagement has proven key to maintaining high levels of active programme participants which then leads to a subsequent high levels of project submissions as well.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             4. Reporting\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnother key point that differentiates Encode Club from their competitors is the neverending attention to detail and data-driven approach which is at the core of all of their activities. Encode partners get to benefit from this, by leveraging pre-existing information on talent taking part of their programmes, identifying the best participants and even directly engaging with them. This approach allows for spotting top hackers and systematically pinpoint top performers even if their current work is their very first engagement with a specific ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             5. Engagement\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFinishing a programme is anything but the end for a hacker’s journey when it comes to their Encode experience. Encode will make sure to go the extra mile for all participants that have shown exceptional skills and dedication throughout a programme and make sure to follow up and provide support throughout these builders’ web3 journeys. Such may include, but not limited to - introductions to other prominent members of the Encode developer community, providing feedback for future projects, as well as facilitating intros to potential investors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IV. Proposal\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants programme that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\\\\n\\\\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the programme that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the DAO.\\\\n\\\\nEncode is to be allocated $2-5MM for the duration of the grants programme. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards. Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the programme.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"V. Reasoning\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programmes that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\\\\n\\\\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://medium.com/encode-club/bounties4bandits-the-bandits-have-saddled-up-39c2ae45f676\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle’s successful grants programme\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\", their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a programme of this magnitude.\\\\n\\\\nVI. Past Experience\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe last time Encode was entrusted with running a grant programme was during the early months of 2022 when Saddle delegated the responsibility for running several editions of these to the Encode team. The two installments of the programme proved to be very successful and the young project managed to engage hundreds of developers to explore, build and contribute to their project.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             1. Delegation\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nEncode shines most prominently when entrusted with handling as many of the intricacies of a given programme as possible. Once general deliverables and goals were outlined by both parties, Encode was then allowed to lead the rest of the programme on its own with regular check-ins and update calls added to the diary in advance. This led to programme specific decisions to be made within Encode based on their team’s expertise, while keeping the sponsors with a hand on the wheel regarding the general direction of the programme itself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             2. Preparation\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMultiple calls were done by both parties in order to properly identify the needs of the sponsor and the extent to which Encode can adjust in order to meet them. The results were carefully crafted tracks of challenges (both technical and non-technical) that were to serve as a guiding point for developers and enthusiasts alike to try and conquer. Example of such were:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Technical Bounties\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nFork Saddle code to bring stablecoin swaps to alt chains\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Applications and integrations built with/on top of Saddle\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Staking functionality on Saddle dApp\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"dApp dashboard for Saddle LPs\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Analytics for Saddle protocol and pools\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Non-technical Bounties\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nUsability research and user testing\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle swag mockups\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Memes\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Saddle-inspired NFT art\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"AMAs with your favourite crypto communities\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\t\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe challenges proved to be a great mix of both accessible and hard to accomplish, which led to great levels of engagement from both within and outside the Encode community.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             3. Execution\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSeries of events were outlined from the get go to keep the public informed and engaged with the developments around the grants programme. With all of them being live, participants had the opportunity to directly engage with both the Saddle and Encode team, ask questions and get support for their projects.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional educational events were included, hosted by Encode with speakers from Saddle, that would provide further depth to the bounties and a proper way to tackle them in a way that would lead to a successful grant allocation. These sessions proved key for keeping the community’s attention high and up-to-date with all latest developments.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, dedicated highlight events were introduced to serve as a show-and-tell for developers and builders, where they would get the chance to present their work in front of the grants team and eventually compete for one. Those event ended up as a fantastic opportunity for grant participants to compare their work and receive constructive feedback from the Saddle team.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"             4. Evaluations\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOnce the first batch of grants were distributed, the Encode team went through a vigorous evaluation process with the Saddle team. The purpose of this was to maintain a close connection with their team as well as make sure their goals were being met accordingly and standard of the programme and its execution would meet their high expectations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"VII. Success Stories\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nHaving organised so many successful programmes over the past several years, Encode is proud to have witnessed multiple great stories of hard work, true dedication and subsequent great success.

is looking forward to collaborating with the Evmos community and would like to propose registering $CMDX and $CMST as ERC-20 tokens on Evmos. When a proposal is initiated for an existing native Cosmos Coin, the ERC20 module will deploy a factory ERC20 contract representing the ERC20 token for the token pair. This enables access to DeFi protocols, NFT, and new applications that are based on ERC-20 (like AAVE, Diffusion, etc.)\n\nBackground\n\nComdex is building a DeFi infrastructure layer for the Cosmos ecosystem. A layer-1 infrastructure system for seamless deployment of DeFi applications in the Cosmos ecosystem, powering DeFi in the multi-chain future.\n\nThe core set of dApps on the chain will help form the foundation layer of money markets for Cosmos, namely:\n\nHarbor protocol: Interchain Stablecoin Issuance Protocol for $CMST (overcollateralized stablecoin)\n\ncSwap DEX: Hybrid Orderbook-style AMM DEX\n\nCommodo: Interchain liquidity protocol for lending-borrowing\n\nThese dApps form the foundational blocks of composable DeFi \"Legos,\" which will ultimately help users have democratized access to interchain money markets to ultimately integrate off-chain CeFi assets into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Harbor Protocol and cSwap are now live on the mainnet, and we're looking forward to potential partnership opportunities and exploring synergies between the Evmos and Comdex ecosystems.\n\nCMST would serve as a native decentralized stablecoin for the Evmos ecosystem.

Evmos Core team wants to start a discussion around a possible adjust to the current EVMOS token inflation schedule through changing the Decay Factor in a way that preserves the initial 4 year distribution target of 1 Billion EVMOS tokens. Considering the current macro environment, the current token inflation schedule may need to be adjusted in order to preserve the long term success of the Evmos ecosystem. The Evmos Core team has provided information below that is meant to serve as reference points for the community to provide input and guidance on any final adjustment decisions.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Evmos token model is designed to distribute a total of 1 Billion tokens after 4 years, with high inflation in the early stages aimed at bootstrapping the ecosystem in a competitive environment. Recent events have altered the macro environment, and reasonably calls for a review to make sure we align with current times. One way to remain flexible during these times without making any substantial changes to the token model would be to take some of the initially planned inflation in the earlier stages and spread them out in a more responsible way that still meets the same 4 year supply target of 1 Billion tokens.\n\nThe inflation distribution for staking, usage incentives and community pool is implemented through an exponential formula, a.k.a. the Half Life.\n\nInflation is minted in daily epochs. During a period of 365 epochs (one year), a daily provision ( epochProvison ) of Evmos tokens is minted and allocated to staking rewards, usage incentives and the community pool. The epoch provision depends on module parameters and is recalculated at the end of every epoch.\n\nThe calculation of the epoch provision is done according to the following formula:\n\nperiodProvision = exponentialDecay * bondingIncentive\n\nf(x) = (a * (1 - r) ^ x + c) * (1 + maxVariance * (1 - bondedRatio / bondingTarget))\n\nepochProvision = periodProvision / epochsPerPeriod\n\nwhere (with default values):\n\nx = variable = year\n\na = 300,000,000 = initial value\n\nr = 0.5 = decay factor\n\nc = 9,375,000 = long term supply\n\nbondedRatio = variable = fraction of the staking tokens which are currently bonded\n\nmaxVariance = 0.0 = the max amount to increase inflation\n\nbondingTarget = 0.66 = our optimal bonded ratio\n\nPossible Changes to the Decay Factor:\n\nBelow are tables with the Half Life formula that show examples of possible changes to staking APR, total inflation, and daily minted EVMOS tokens and serve as a reference points for discussion. These changes can be made all at once, or spread out over a period of time to limit any possible side effects.\n\nPlease note, the Year 1 Epoch table in the top right will be inaccurate as days go by but do not effect any information provided.\n\nScenario 1: A change from .5 to .3596828656 to the decay function:\n\n-Inflation change: 79.92% to 48.5%\n\n-Staking APR Change: 122.11% to 91.72%\n\n(image)\n\nScenario 2: A change from .5 to .15911367446 to the decay function:\n\n-Inflation change: 79.92% to 35.38%\n\n-Staking APR Change: 122.11% to 62.91%\n\n(image)\n\nNo Change:\n\n(image)\n\n*Note: The 100k difference in tokens is the testnet rewards that aren't included in these numbers .\n\nPoints for Discussion:\n\nIs a proactive approach to adjusting inflation a path that token holders are in favor of?\n\nUsing the provided reference points for possible changes to the decay function, what is a responsible target to aim for of changes are to be made?\n\nIf adjustments are made, would spreading out the total change help the network limit any unseen side effects?\n\nWith previous LP incentive initiatives ending and the upcoming halvening, what effect will that have on current token holder behavior?\n\nWill this lead to any unforeseen effects that need to be taken into account?\n\nImportant Notes:\n\nThis will make NO  change to the total supply, nor the targeted amount of 1 Billion EVMOS tokens after 4 years.

Considering the current macro environment, the current token inflation schedule may need to be adjusted in order to preserve the long term success of the Evmos ecosystem. The Evmos Core team has provided information below that is meant to serve as reference points for the community to provide input and guidance on any final adjustment decisions. \\\\n\\\\nAbstract\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThe Evmos token model is designed to distribute a total of 1 Billion tokens after 4 years, with high inflation in the early stages aimed at bootstrapping the ecosystem in a competitive environment. Recent events have caused the Macro environment to take a complete turn, and reasonably calls for some consideration into how/if any changes need to be made in order to better reflect the current times. One way to remain flexible during these times without making any substantial changes to the token model would be to take some of the initially planned inflation in the earlier stages and spread them out in a more responsible way that still meets the same 4 year supply target of 1 Billion tokens.\\\\n\\\\nThe inflation distribution for staking, usage incentives and community pool is implemented through an exponential formula, a.k.a. the Half Life.\\\\n\\\\nInflation is minted in daily epochs. During a period of 365 epochs (one year), a daily provision (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"epochProvison\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\") of Evmos tokens is minted and allocated to staking rewards, usage incentives and the community pool.

proposal would raise the minimum amount of EVMOS tokens to be deposited for a proposal to reach on-chain voting from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS with the intentions to maintain high quality proposals and prevent spam from going on chain.\n\nAbstract\n\nProposal Deposit Concept:\n\nFor governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be submitted with a deposit of the amount defined by the min_deposit  param in the governance module before the deposit end time.\n\nA proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.\n\nThe proposer account is only required to deposit ~1 EVMOS .\n\nDeposit Refund and Burn Concept:\n\nIf the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount.\n\nIf the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.\n\nMotivation\n\nProposal to Increase Deposit Amount:\n\nBy the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit requires 192 EVMOS  or approximately 60  in USD  equivalent. Currently, is a low threshold to help ensure quality proposals and prevent possible spam proposals. Comparing other cosmos governance current deposits, the Cosmos hub requires 250 ATOM or 2,280 USD and Osmosis requires 1600 OSMO or 1,193 USD for proposals to enter the on-chain voting stage.\n\nWith the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to 3500 EVMOS  or approximately 1,100  in USD  equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nCommunity Members must not  be priced out of making proposals on chain. 3500 EVMOS  is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, whilst still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves.\n\nMultiple wallets may fund any proposal deposit, so this remains within the realm of most Cosmos users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, where a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking.\n\nVoting:\n\nBy voting YES , you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS.\n\nBy voting NO , you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements.\n\nBy voting ABSTAIN , you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\nBy voting NOWITHVETO , you seek penalizing the proposal depositors by burning their deposit of 192 EVMOS, and contribute towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold, which would result in proposal failure if reached.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1177,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-27T18:44:58.940Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos14rsst0wnenhpxqv0drtvmz5jegp2dtcpf0srcl\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Tricky\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-22T01:12:04.490Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Summary\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis

Varadinov ( @vladfortech ), Evmos Core Teams\n\nParameters being changed with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 95% . The remainder 5% is to prevent spam.\n\nThe current module parameters can be queried as follows:\n\n➜ evmosd q revenue params --node=https://tendermint.bd.evmos.org:26657 addr_derivation_cost_create: \"50\" developer_shares: \"0.500000000000000000\" enable_revenue: true\n\nMotivation\n\nThe x/revenue module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the Evmos Token Model  , this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The developer_shares parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.\n\nConsidering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 95% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.\n\nWe acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.\n\nIf this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the commission on staking rewards and 95% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.\n\nImpact\n\nRegistered smart contracts will receive 95% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.\n\nBelow are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:\n\nAt current Evmos price ($0.40637) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.00466466 * 200000 txs * 0.95 = $886.29\n\nAt Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.01669652 * 100000 txs * 0.95 = $1,586.17\n\nAt optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: $0.03756717 * 50000 txs * 0.95 = $1,784.43\n\nGas price calculations were generated with this calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBefore voting, please read through this proposal and the current comments.

Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees.

thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place. Community members have expressed concerns over this, and have proposed moving back the decay date to a later date and to reimburse the decayed tokens.\n\nPLAN OF ACTION\n\nWe delay the start of the Rektdrop decay to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022.\n\nSignal commitment to reimburse anyone who experienced decay on their airdrop before the newly set date of Monday August 1st, 2022 . These tokens will be reimbursed from the community pool at a later date after all the data is gathered and verified.\n\nWe fast track this proposal on chain if there are no concerns or red flags from the community to limit the amount of decay users experience and make step 2 simpler.\n\nThis will not only ensure users don't experience decay at no fault of their own, but also give more time for new users to claim this airdrop to promote healthy token distribution for Evmos.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe push back the Rektdropt decay date to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022 @ approximately 09:00 UTC. We signal agreement that any user who experienced decay before the newly set decay date should have those tokens reimbursed by the community pool at a later time after we gather the proper info and come up with the plan to send these funds back.\n\nConsidering the start of decay being less than the socially agreed 3 days for a commonwealth discussion, we may fast track this proposal on chain to limit the decay for users if there is no opposition from community members.\n\nI will update the thread with relevant information and decisions as the discussion matures and it is needed.

everyone,\n\nThis thread details all things related to the v10 upgrade to the Evmos network. Please review and share your thoughts with us. We are looking forward to the next upgrade.\n\nDescription\n\nMalte Herrmann, Evmos Core Team (Author)\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos Mainnet software upgrade at block height 9,495,000  from its current version v9.1.0  to v10.0.0 .\n\nMotivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our Software Upgrade Guide .\n\nImpact\n\nOn a high level, the v10.0.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\nUpdate Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.7, IBC-Go to v5.2.0 and Ethermint to v0.20.0\n\nAutomatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving\n\nSupport for ERC20 token transfers via IBC\n\nERC20 proposals to register ERC20 tokens and Cosmos coins now can receive multiple denominations\n\nPrioritized mempool support for Cosmos and Ethereum txs\n\nEIP-1559 support for native Cosmos transactions\n\nEIP-712 fixes for all major Cosmos messages (eg: MsgGrant for restake support)\n\nAdd Ledger support to the evmosd CLI\n\nEthereum Tx indexer\n\nThe funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated\n\nIntroduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)\n\nEIP-712 fixes for the vesting module\n\nAdd a default file store listener for a basic implementation of ADR-038: State Listening\n\nUpdate default node snapshot interval to 5000 seconds\n\nUpdate Ledger supported algorithms to only consist of EthSecp256k1\n\nA full changelog can be found here .\n\nNOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\n\nTesting\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found here . Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":"","topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-12-13T23:58:32.250Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1my3w8f69wxqajwj64lt07ws97u4em4rjcvvwr8\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"mmm\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-12-13T23:00:25.570Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Greetings everyone,\\\\n\\\\nThis thread details all things related to the v10 upgrade to the Evmos network.

For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\n\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade.

everyone! \n\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes. This is a good example of the importance of testing upgrades in a testnet environment. The main issue that we discovered was that Metamask transactions could not be submitted, because the UI didn't allow large differences between the base fee and the min gas price. \n\nThis thread is following up with scheduling the `v6.0.1` software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000\n](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200 ) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v6.0.1` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters.\n* Allow Metamask transactions with min gas price\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `20,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5922-evmos-software-upgrade-v601).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-28T20:52:29.676Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-17T14:01:27.792Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"Hey everyone! \\n\\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes.

I'm opening up this thread on scheduling the next software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v5.0.0` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `25,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5467-evmos-software-upgrade-v500).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Rejected","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-15T09:17:12.625Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-10T13:14:21.547Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Author\\n\\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\\n\\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at bloc height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\n\n## Authors \n- LPX | Evmos DAO\n- GV | Evmos DAO \n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n\nThis proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)). An [FAQ page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/faq.md) has been created and will kept up to date with important questions asked by the Community.\n\n## Preface \n\nFollowing the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.\n\nAddressed issues from Proposal 86:\n\n1. The total token request has been significantly [reduced by 61% in this proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n2. R&D and the Ecosystem Bootstrap fund have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.\n3. The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).\n4. Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### The Governance Workstream's Mandate\n\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\n- Duties, Responsibilities, Deliverables of the Governance Workstream: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/duties.md)\n\n### Contributions to Evmos\n\nThe Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars. \n\n- List of Achievements and Progress Report: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/report.md)\n\n### Progressive Decentralization \n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\n\nWhile we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThis 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~61% to the previous proposal and represents now 1.6% of the community pool. The dollar amount requested at current price was also reduced from $2.37mil to $740K. For a breakdown of the ask reduction, please [refer to this page.](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n\nThe new funding request looks like the following: \n- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 950,000 EVMOS\n- ~~**B. Treasury Diversification & Reserves:** 1,000,000 EVMOS~~ _deferred_\n- **Total:** 950,000 EVMOS\n\n**A. Contributor Compensations**\n\nThe funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.\n- A detailed outline of contributor compensation: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/contributors.md)\n\n**B. Treasury Diversification & Reserves**\n\nOne of the first treasury strengthening initiatives will be to slowly diversify our assets into stablecoins. This initiative will continue to be a core strategy of the DAO, as it allows for a safe, predictable runway of contributor payments, the usage of smart contract based DAO contributor payments systems, and is an excellent hedge against uncertain market conditions.\n\nOur stablecoin acquisitions will not be through selling tokens on the open market, but through DAO2DAO token-for-stable swaps, sales of convertible bonds, and DeFi protocols that are available to us. Some partners we are in discussions with and plan to work with include ShapeShift DAO, Hedgey Finance, PrimeDAO, and Arbor Finance. Tokens will only be sold when absolutely necessary in small batches. \n\nA small reserve will be kept for operational expenses (tools, subscriptions, licenses) and micro-payments for services that do not warrant an on-chain proposal. \n\n### Fund Disbursements\n\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury\" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 5 Validators in a `5-8` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending will be publicly viewable with full transparency. Spending, compensations, swaps, and all expense reports will be rigorously kept up to date. \n\n**Treasury Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- OutCast | Legion Nodes\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n- Yubin Park | a41\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600) (evmos1c0z326g3haflz2gnk68q2vsfv5mtxpsqgqgd0v)\n\n*The total funding request of the proposal may be adjusted accordingly in the event of market volatility and major price swings. This clause serves as a safeguard for our planned 6-month runway and our treasury diversification plans, and is a notice to the Evmos community that the final ask amount may be different than what is being presented today.*\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2023-01-18T12:50:06.091Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos177ggk979ag3cjyt6vevzep2spl3xyfdtsq0937\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Evmos DAO\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/503fc65a-9177-474e-83f4-e159cefb3173.jpg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2023-01-18T11:42:33.766Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\" ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"## Authors \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n- LPX | Evmos DAO\\\\n- GV | Evmos DAO \\\\n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\\\\n\\\\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\")), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months.

ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\n\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\n\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \n\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \n\n---\n\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\n\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\n\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\n\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\n\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \n\n\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\n\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\n\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\n\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\n\n## 4. Workstream Stages\n\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\n\n - Informal\n - Proposed\n - Active\n - Inactive\n\n\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\n\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n\n**Compensation Principles**\n\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\n\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO. Talented and dedicated members should want to remain working with the DAO.\n\n**Compensation Types**\n\n1) **Retroactive Compensation**: compensation and rewards for previous contributions made to the DAO. There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \n\n**Compensation Eligibility**\n\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. \n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment\n- The monthly compensation amount\n- Compensation rationale (base and vested)\n\n## Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment | Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. | Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training. | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role. | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill. Contributor should have experience in the domain and will be expected to excel in assigned duties. | Difficult to replace, domain-expertise in addition to deep organizational-specific knowledge required (i.e. knowledge in the DAO's governance processes, financial and revenue structures, ongoing projects, etc.) |\n| Contribution Importance | The level of importance of the duties held by a contributor for the long-term success of the DAO as well as the Evmos network. | Little to no effect on the Evmos ecosystem. Such roles are likely to be in experimental workstreams or external-facing projects. | Important to the long-term growth of the Evmos ecosystem. | Crucial importance - contributions will have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and the Evmos ecosystem. |\n| Value Level | Calculated by simply taking the average of the three aforementioned assessments. | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n\n2. **Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios:\n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking.\n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle:\n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Self | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties. |\n| 1.5 | Workstream / subDAO | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream. |\n| 2 | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3. |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO.\n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n**Exhibit D: MVP Vesting Contract Dashboard for Admins and Contributors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmCC9oy.png)\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:19:11.205Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\\n\\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \\n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \\n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \\n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\\n\\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \\n\\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\\n\\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\\n\\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\\n\\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\\n\\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\\n\\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \\n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \\n\\n\\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\\n\\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\\n\\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\\n\\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\\n\\n## 4. Workstream Stages\\n\\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\\n\\n - Informal\\n - Proposed\\n - Active\\n - Inactive\\n\\n\\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\\n\\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\\n\\n**Compensation Principles**\\n\\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\\n\\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO.

There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \\n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \\n\\n**Compensation Eligibility**\\n\\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO.

This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:19:11.210Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T00:26:54.839Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-02T14:28:44.187Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-29T14:20:04.863Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2023-01-18T20:44:37.965Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

This document is a condensed version of the ECP Framework; for the full-length version refer to the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provide a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.\n\nThe Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n\n**Motivation:** The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. The Governance Workstream and the Community have been self-regulating and informally enforcing the general guidelines posted in [“Best Practices”](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) — however, as we prepare to expand the scope and responsibilities of Evmos DAO, we must prepare for another influx of proposals by providing clear guidelines and proposal standardization. \n\nWe strongly believe that our governance participation is among the highest in the blockchain space because of our continued efforts in building a culture of open discussion, strong due diligence, helping one another, and our willingness to assist newcomers navigate the waters of governance. While I am confident that our Community will continue building great culture, a standardized proposal framework and clear lifecycle guideline will ensure that our governance continues on this path for the long-term.\n\n---\n\n# ECP Framework Components\n\n## 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\n\n### Proposal Types\n\n**On-Chain Governance**\n\nOn-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes and takes precedence over the delegated validators of the voter. \n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance**\n\nOff-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. \n\n### Proposal Types by Category\n\n - Protocol Proposals\n - Community Proposals\n - Meta-Governance Proposals\n - Workstreams & Special Initiatives\n - Community Grants & Funding\n - Protocol Incentives & Evmos Specific Proposals\n - Network Upgrades and Security\n\nRefer to the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/definitions) for more details.\n\n\n## 2. The ECP Lifecycle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D8IcfJS.png)\n\n**Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \\[IDEATION\\]**\n\nThe purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. \n\nAnyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.\n\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PRE-PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nPhase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an Evmos Community Proposal and includes all of the criteria specified in the ECP Framework. It must be a clear and complete description of the discussions and ideas held in the previous phase. \n\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nThe author may finalize the ECP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must add a poll within the thread to gauge the community sentiment.\n\nProposals should only move to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments, responded to all concerns and questions, and believes that the proposal is ready to go on-chain for a final network-wide vote. Proposals in Phase 3 should not be edited further with the exception of minor mistakes. \n\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: \\[VOTING\\]**\n\nIf the signaling polls in Phase 3 show an overall positive sentiment and no major issues are brought up, the proposal may be submitted on-chain for the formal voting. Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\n\n\n### Exceptions to the Framework\n\n**Governance Council**\n\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \"fast-track\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\n\n**Core Developers**\n\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\n\n\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\n\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \n\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\n\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\n\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\n\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:16:21.430Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\\n\\n\\n### Exceptions to the Framework\\n\\n**Governance Council**\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \\\"fast-track\\\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\\n\\n**Core Developers**\\n\\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\\n\\n\\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\\n\\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \\n\\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\\n\\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\\n\\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\\n\\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\\n\\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:16:21.436Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T01:00:35.190Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-12-03T08:20:49.073Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-29T14:20:04.863Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2023-01-18T20:44:37.965Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

ECP-0: Proposals to Advance Governance and Support the Growth of Evmos DAO and the Network Ecosystem\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** The following proposals are the culmination of thousands of hours of research and calculated deliberation. I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \n\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \n\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\n\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\n\n---\n\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \n\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \n\n---\n\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \n\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \\n\\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \\n\\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \\n\\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\\n\\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \\n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\\n\\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\\n\\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \\n\\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\\n\\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \\n\\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\\n\\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \\n\\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\\n\\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \\n\\n---\\n\\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \\n\\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes.

 Govmos Team (a multi-chain volunteer initiative to reform Cosmos governance)\n\nSummary : This proposal seeks to formalize the structure of DAO councils. Introducing 4 \"council types\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce a technical solution to separate security & vote delegation of the tokens. Allowing users to both delegate security to a validator and delegate vote to a council.\n\nAbstract:  Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix ). By doing this we end up with a much more decentralized system where every market participant is represented (appendix 2) compared to the current one in which only team & validators do governance. Each council type having a clear role to play in the ecosystem's governance balance (appendix 3).\n\nMotivation:  Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs.\n\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\n\n1- History :\n\nFollowing from the rejected vote of the proposition #86 ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the community funds requested by the \"main-DAO\". This main-DAO that was recently formalized in the previous proposition #83 by the same persons willing to occupy the DAO seats. First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the candidates & one to request the funding. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would probably push to centralize the system.\n\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted.\n\n2- Govmos Proposition :\n\nNow that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\n\na) Separating Security & Governance Delegation\n\nWe have multiple solutions here, but the endgame is to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power to. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\n\nIF the token holder cast the vote himself THEN the vote is casted\n\nELSE IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\n\nIF he delegated his vote to a council, THEN the council cast the vote on his behalf.\n\nELSE the validator(s) which he delegated to can cast the vote instead.\n\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\n\nb) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\n\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \"council types\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \"council type\" can have as many \"councils\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\n\nHere are the formal amendments :\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\n\nThe \"main-DAO\" requires all 4 council types to be \"active\".\n\nThe 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\n\nEach council must have separate accounting in the Treasury Module.\n\nEach council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered \"active\"\n\nEach council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\n\nFoundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \"foundation council\".\n\nWallets related to validators + validator delegations (excl. liquid stake) for any \"validators council\".\n\nAddresses having deployed smart contracts for any \"developer council\"\n\nAddresses having never transacted with the above for any \"delegator council\"\n\nCouncils are prohibited to use or request Community Pool funds.\n\nIf the \"main-DAO\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \"Inactive\".\n\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \"active\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. In order to understand which role each council type could play in the DAO, you can refer to the Appendix 2 & 4 at the bottom of that post.\n\nc) Improving on ECP-1A vision\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \"main-DAO\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \"main DAO\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\n\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\n\n3- Govmos vision :\n\nWe want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details.

Introducing 4 \\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\" : delegators, developers, validators and foundation councils. Each one being clearly separated from the others by regulated capital flows. If passed, this structure proposal will amend the current ECP-1B and put all 4 councils as required at the main-DAO level. Agreement on this proposal would also signal & initiate the [IDEATION] phase to introduce the Treasury Module meant to regulate capital flows of the councils in a transparent and trust-minimized way. As well as signaling an update on the forthcoming Liquid Staking Module (LSM)\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstract:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our model for a scalable & decentralized governing system wants every chain participants to be equally represented in the governance framework. We also explain why this task requires to account for the natural imbalance existing between these actors (cf. fig.1 on the appendix). Our proposition states that the most accurate way to auto-regulate the system is to separate capital flows between the councils and define a clear set of standards & rules to regulate such flows. Our model also states that the current system of a \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"sub-DAOs\\\\\\\" workstream is extremely centralized and we will explain why such system has failed in its chain approval process lately. We seek to replace that formal system by implementing 4 types of councils that will compose the aforementioned \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" to maintain its critical center role as decentralized as possible. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Motivation:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" Our commitment to reform governance is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic. That's why this proposal is meant to set the ground rules for every chain to use and not specifically Evmos. Therefore some of our proposed capital regulations will remain limited to the strict minimum. This is meant to leave an opened door for each chain using that model to fine-tune the specifications to their own local needs. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGOVERNING COUNCILS\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"1- History :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Following from the rejected vote of the \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/86\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #86\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" ([ECP-2A] Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream) the community of stakers has expressed a lot of legitimate concerns about the legitimacy of that proposal and the centralization issues coming along the proposition to fund the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". This main-DAO was formalized in the previous \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"proposition #83\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\". First we want to highlight that the proposition 83 didn't follow the guidelines and should have been proposed as two separate votes for ECP-2A & 2B. One to formalize the structure & one to request the funding. By pushing them both in a same proposal the community couldn't vote on each. At Govmos we disagree entirely with type of behavior. We will also explain why we anticipated long before ECP2 that the foundation-side of governance would push to centralize the system.\\\\n\\\\nThat's basically what happened with the ECP framework.. A few people created seats which had already their names on them. Ready for them to take places on the main-DAO they created and regulated themselves. This might be a legitimate and good-will claim today but this process of main versus sub-DAO is not rigorous enough and has way too many trust assumptions associated with it when the main-DAO is created by those who claim the seats. We have warned their creators that this was deemed to fail but they decided to still move ahead with prop#86. It has received fierce contestation and rejection as we initially predicted. \\\\n\\\\n2- Govmos Proposition :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Now that on-chain has stopped the ECP project, it's time to think about ways to amend the initial proposition and keep advancing in the right direction. The ECP framework had a lot of good things to take out of. Our plan is to grow out of it by taking off the best of the preceding efforts the creators putted in to the ECP. As mentioned before the ECP -2A & 2B should have been separated but ECP-1A and 1B also, and therefore as both have been passed all at once, we propose to amend the 1B part of it. But to have that new proposition working, first we need to signal a development requirement of the liquid staking module.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"a) Signaling an update to the Liquid Staking Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe plan to use the forthcoming LSM (Liquid Staking Module) to break the existing bond we have today between chain's security & governance. When you stake your token, you also delegate your voting rights to the validator you delegated your security power. This bond can be easily broken by introducing \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Liquid Staked Vote Transport\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" (LSVT). This would allow the voting rights of the liquid staked tokens to be transferred along with them instead of the validators. The modeling here is pretty simple and can be explained by these rules :\\\\nThe holder can cast his own vote if he wants to.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user don't cast his vote THEN :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the liquid staked token is deposited in the Treasury THEN the council who has that delegated token can cast the vote on the holder's behalf.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"IF the user has not delegated its token in the Treasury THEN the vote is casted by the validators he has chosen to delegate its security to (the existing model).\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nIf we use this system, then decentralizing governance is possible down to the single token precision. As each token will have the choice to either vote directly, vote through a delegate person (the council the holder has chose to delegate that token to) or vote according to the security choice otherwise (as it is today).\\\\nThis step is crucial to our model but the most important part to decentralize governance comes in the next part.\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"b) Formalize Council types & Amend ECP-1B\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe want to add structure to the main DAO by explicitly adding 4 \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\\\\"council types\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" to the main-DAO architecture. Each \\\\\\\"council type\\\\\\\" can have as many \\\\\\\"councils\\\\\\\" as it wants. The sub-DAOs system proposed in ECP1-B can keep its original form even if we think they might not have a required existence before years. We think multiple councils will likely take over the workflow as their internal council's operations (more on that later).\\\\n\\\\nHere are the formal amendments :\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" active status can only formalize with an on-chain vote\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" requires at least one \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\" council for each of the 4 council types.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"The 4 council types are : Foundation Council, Validators Council, Developers Council and Delegators Council.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council must have separate accounting.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least 5% cumulative vote power to be considered registered\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Each council type must have at least half of its cumulative vote power coming from :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Foundation wallets & registered Team wallets for any \\\\\\\"foundation council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Validators delegated tokens (non liquid-staked) for any \\\\\\\"validators council\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having deployed smart contracts for any \\\\\\\"developer council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Addresses having never transacted with the above for any \\\\\\\"delegator council\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"indent\\\":1,\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"If the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\" is proven to fail on any of these aforementioned rules, it is immediately set to \\\\\\\"Inactive\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThese rules entail the base layer of a durable system. It's meant to define and enforce the stricter rules a DAO needs to formalize. It requires that each Council type (4 of them) must register at least one council to exist. The sum of these councils' relative vote power must exceed 5% to consider a council type as \\\\\\\"active\\\\\\\". This guarantees a minimum representation of each party in the global system. Another necessary protection layer consists of requiring at least half of the delegated voting power of a council type to come from specific types of wallets in the chain. This is meant to prevent fraud from illegitimate users claiming rights of one council type which they don't belong to. \\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"c) Improving on ECP-1A vision\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, we think there were some severe flaws in the ECP proposition by design but we also think that it makes no sense not to recognize there were good intentions and very good work behind that. Therefore we want to express gratitude and build upon that initial vision that have been share in the Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned) section of ECP-1A. We think these should be the main drivers of the \\\\\\\"main-DAO\\\\\\\". We just think the main-DAO should not be handled by 3 seats deciding how to allocate tremendous capital amounts with little to no accountability. Actually we deeply think that the original \\\\\\\"main DAO\\\\\\\" members would make perfect candidates for the Foundation Council. But our system says they should be 1/4 in the balance of forces in the main-DAO along with 3 other competing council types which all have different motivations. All serving a democratic debate in the governance forums to create the best possible proposals and use of the common funds. That's why our set of rules strictly stipulate that \\\\\\\"Active Councils are prohibited to request Community Pool funds.\\\\\\\" Councils can't decide on their own. They have to reach an agreement through the ECP proposal framework and only they, collectively, can request capital allocation via on-chain governance.\\\\n\\\\nOur model also predicts that the governance of high-growth chains will become more and more complex. This system can scale accordingly as there will likely be multiple councils competing in each council type. This will ensure that no one will ever have a safe seat by constantly having competition forces at play to remove complacent actors. So this model doesn't just improve on decentralization, it solves the problems of accountability & scalability.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"d) Prepare Discussion on the Treasury Module\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nWe also consider essential to have each council having a separate accounting in the forthcoming Treasury Module; it will be in charge of regulating capital flows in the councils with smart contracts. This is meant to reduce trust assumptions to the minimum by enforcing the rules that allow capital to move inside the council. It shall restricts spending & specify the potential compensations the council members may ask for (using the compensation framework proposed in ECP-1B which we think can be applied in its current form without amendments). \\\\n\\\\nBut we insist that the money flows inside councils MUST be regulated in a specific chain module via smart contracts. This process should not require ratification by on-chain governance (as opposed to community pool allocation) as its to the discretion of each council to formalize its own internal operating rules & compensation frameworks. \\\\n\\\\nWe have detailed the reasons why different councils may have different models in our research publication (cf. appendix 4)\\\\nThe token holders will have to do their due-diligence before delegating their liquid staked tokens to a council via the treasury module. As some councils may use the delegated funds to pay for regular expenses & the compensation framework (see page 4 of the research). Of course on a separate proposal we will explore the base protection & standards required to these treasury module smart contracts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n3- Govmos vision :\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We want to remind you that our mission is as an independent, volunteer and multi-chain initiative. So we are bound to be chain agnostic and this proposal sets the backbone for future similar proposals that we intend to make on other Cosmos chains. We have intentionally focus on the core architecture in this first proposal. Most of the execution complexity will be at the Treasury Module's Smart Contract (TMSC) layer. This is why we separated this for a second proposal which we think will have to be more chain specific. Moreover we also think that this is no one's power to decide where governance should go precisely on it's execution. We believe in market forces & competition between councils to drive TMSC standards naturally. Forcing out the bad actors & improving over time. In our research we have also described how we think that having these council type DAOs in multiple Cosmos chains will dramatically boost interchain cooperation (cf appendix 1). We envision that within a year of existance, the first InterChain Councils (or ICC) should start to thrive and push the cosmos closer to the mesh system that founders envisioned at the very beginning. Mesh networks shall have mesh governance. That's what our system ultimately has been build for.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCONCLUSION\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We decided to make that proposal as short as possible to remain within a 10m reading range and avoid unnecessary lengthy details.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Authors:** \n\n- LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend. With a participation rate of almost 90%, the Governance Workstream will most likely be fighting to maintain the status quo, as we are almost at the ceiling.\n\n| Rank | Network  | Voter Turnout | Sample Data (20 Props) | Data |\n| ---- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |-------------|\n| 1    | Evmos    | 87.35%        | Proposals 44 - 64                 | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1701165887)  |\n| 2    | Juno     | 82.88%        | Proposals 14 - 39                   | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=248293121)  |\n| 3    | Osmosis  | 64.74%        | Proposals 319 - 340                | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1919390603)   |\n| 4    | Stargaze | 61.85%        | Proposals 30 - 53                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=508354030) |\n| 5    | Cosmos   | 47.49%        | Proposals 56 - 77                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=206262929) |\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7I6nd2O.png)\n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nIn addition to all the proposals that have gone on-chain, the Evmos Community has seen a tremendous, sustained growth in off-chain governance participation, specifically on Commonwealth.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/413Pd2P.png)\n\n---\n\n### Workstream Members and Organizational Structure\n\n**Workstream Structure**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of \n - This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the stewards rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy.\n - Workstream leaders in their second term are automatically elected to a Governance Council Director role.\n - In practice, it is expected that Council Contributors and Council Directors operate and communicate as equals.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 267,614 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 500,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 700,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,792,614 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles. The goal of these full-time contributor roles is to find the next leaders that will step up and establish their own workstreams. \\n\\n - Department of Education\\n \\n     - The mission of the Department of Education is to develop, maintain, and promote educational contents and programs for the Evmos Community. \\n     - This includes the creation of interactive educational content in governance related topics, and eventually the creation of technical content for developers.\\n\\n - Department of Communications\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of Communications is responsible for creating and coordinating direct dialogue between the Evmos DAO and the diverse Community Members.\\n     - Through outreach, communication, townhall meetings, and official announcements from the Governance Council and the various workstreams of the DAO, the Dept. of Communications removes obstacles and barriers and creates opportunities to improve public awareness and involvement in the DAO.\\n     - The Department of Communications will also be responsible for the creation of documentation and communication channels in non-English languages.\\n     - The Department of Communications helps build and maintain the transparent, responsible, and accountable governance system that the Constitution calls for.\\n\\n\\n - Department of Growth & Outreach\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of Growth will be responsible for the strategic outreach and engagement of developers, projects, and other DAOs for the purpose of ecosystem growth.\\n     - Through the generation of leads, coordination with biz dev, outreach campaigns, and strategic bounties, the Department of Growth should ramp up community engagement, elevate the Evmos brand and awareness, illustrate our vision, mission, and values, and enable the facilitation of easy onboarding of projects and developers.\\n\\n\\n - Department of Research & Development\\n\\n\\n     - The Department of R&D will work closely with the Governance Council to research, develop, and maintain key infrastructure, public goods, and the development of smart contracts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Compensation Calculations**\\n\\n|Name |PT/FT | Base

Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\nThe community may choose to change the parameters of this framework before the beginning of each funding cycle, beginning with the second cycle in mid-2023. This is to allow for the DAO to adjust compensation on market conditions, inflation, etc.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment |   Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 | \n| --------      | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty     | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. |  Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training.  | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size  | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role.  | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill.

Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders. \n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: \n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking. \n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members. \n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle: \n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1     | Self       | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties.     |\n| 1.5     | Workstream / subDAO       | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream.  |\n| 2     | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3.     |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO. \n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n\n---\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\n**Exhibit A: Simple Vesting Contract**\n\nhttps://github.com/EvmosGov/ContributorVestingContract\n\n**Exhibit B: Surya's Description Report**\n\nContract Description Table (Autogenerated)\n\n\n| Contract |    Type    |   Bases   |         |        |\n|:----------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|\n|  └   | **Function Name** | **Visibility** | **Mutability** | **Modifiers** |\n||||||\n| **EvmosVesting** | Implementation | Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, VestingData |||\n| └ | <Constructor> | Public ❗️ | 🛑 |NO❗️ |\n| └ | beneficiary | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | start | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | duration | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revocable | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | released | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | revoked | Public ❗️ | |NO❗️ |\n| └ | release | External ❗️ | 🛑 | nonReentrant |\n| └ | revoke | External ❗️ | 🛑 | onlyOwner nonReentrant |\n| └ | _releasableAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | _vestedAmount | Private 🔐 | | |\n| └ | <Receive Ether> | External ❗️ | 💵 | nonReentrant |\n\n\n Legend\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n|:--------:|-----------|\n|  🛑  | Function can modify state |\n|  💵  | Function is payable |\n\n**Exhibit C: CallGraph**\n\n\n![](https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/1f66f0fd-0fcf-4ca4-a6fd-e916afcb3fd3.1668346573516)\n\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":2491,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-10T18:08:15.675Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-09T17:37:12.548Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Standardized Compensation Framework\\n\\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy.

ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\n\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \n\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \n\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\n\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \n - Community-governed incentives program\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\n\n\n## Motivation \n\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \n\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\n\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \n\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\n\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \n\n\n---\n\n\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\n\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \n\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\n\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\n\n\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\n\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\n\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \n\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \n\n---\n\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\n\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \n\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\n\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \n\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\n\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \n\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\n\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \n\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\n\n\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\n\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community. We hope that our previous efforts are recognized by the Community and is a testament to our genuine dedication to the advancement of the Evmos ecosystem and network. \n\nThe target operational, development, and incentives runway with this funding request is **one year**; however, we hope to extend that runway as much as possible through various programs. On the other hand, the absolute best case scenario for the DAO would be to achieve self-sustainability by late next year. \n\n| # | Initiative | Description | Allocation  | \n| - | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Workstream (SubDAO) Funding | Compensation of current and future workstream members and the funding of workstream initiatives. | 20%     |\n| 2 | GOV Tokenomics & Community Gauges | The $GOV token and the gauge system is designed to decentralize Liquidity Incentives allocation, promote long-term alignments, and facilitate off-chain governance voting. | 12.5%     |\n| 3 | Boosted Liquidity Vaults & veGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that are community-led, more transparent, DEX-agnostic, and shared benefits. | 22.5%     |\n| 4 | Perpetual Bounty Fund & deGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that is community-led, more transparent, and is DEX-agnostic. | 10%     | \n| 5 | Treasury Growth & yGOV | Initial funding for DeFi revenue generation strategies and yield-bearing GOV tokens | 7.5%     |\n| 6 | Treasury Bonds | Building community-owned liquidity through the sales of treasury issued bonds. | 5%     |\n| 7 | Strategic Reserves | The reserves will be used only when strategic opportunities are presented to the DAO or rebalancing of the treasury is necessary.

A combination of tried and true strategies as well as novel implementations in DeFi and smart contracting will be utilized. Heavy inspiration is drawn from well-established and successful DAOs that have pioneered the way in governance philosophies and decentralized finance and economics: MakerDAO, Compound, Curve, Yearn, Gnosis, 1Hive, Uniswap, Sushi, Aave, ShapeShift, Balancer, MolochDAO, and many more.\n\n### GOV: Evmos DAO Governance Base Token Layer\n\nAlignment between the Evmos DAO governance token (GOVMOS, or GOV for short) holders and protocol stakeholders (EVMOS) is crucial for an *efficient* decentralized governance -- GOV tokens are the vehicle to drive this alignment. GOV tokens are not a financial investment, although there will be economic benefits. GOV token holders are typically DAO contributors and Evmos Community members who are committed to seeing the continued growth of the Evmos ecosystem, and want a seat at the governance table.\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work — reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and voting on every matter can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain.\n\nThis approach is not to be a gatekeeper of decisions - anyone who wishes will be able to participate. The key difference between on-chain proposals and off-chain DAO proposals is that DAO governance is *voluntary*. \n\n$GOV will be launched as an ERC20 with a 1:1 EVMOS backing. In simpler terms, depositing one EVMOS token will mint you one GOV token; reciprocally, returning one GOV token will release one EVMOS token. GOV tokens are transferrable, fungible, and tradeable. GOV serves as the base layer token for the many functions of its derivatives. **Holding GOV tokens do not grant any voting power.**\n\n**Important concept to remember:** `$GOVMOS` is essentially `$WEVMOS` but with expanded feature sets that allow the DAO and community participants to create and govern the following derivatives and programs. \n\n### GOV Derivatives Overview\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WN7f8LC.png)\n\n\n### veGOV: Aligned & Incentivized Decentralized Decision Making\n\nParticipating in Evmos DAO governance requires that a wallet have a balance of vote-escrowed GOV (veGOV). veGOV is a non-standard ERC20 implementation, popularized and battle-tested by DAOs on Ethereum, that determines each wallet's voting power.\n\nveGOV is obtained by depositing and locking GOV into the DAO's escrow contract. The maximum lock time is two years, and the minimum one month. \n\nThe amount of veGOV received is proportional to the lock-time selected - locking 100 GOV for the maximum two year period will return 100 veGOV. A one year lock of 100 GOV would return 50 veGOV, and so forth. \n\nOnce veGOV is issued to a wallet the tokens will automatically begin decaying at a 1/2 slope linear rate until the time-lock period is reached. For example, if 500 veGOV tokens were rewarded at the time of deposit, 250 veGOV would remain at the time when the vesting period is complete and the original GOV tokens are available for withdrawal. \n\nUsers may decide to keep the original GOV tokens vested even after the completion date in order to retain the remaining veGOV. However, as soon as the original GOV tokens are claimed back into the originating wallet, the remaining veGOV will burn itself.\n\nThe vote-escrowed approach plays several crucial roles in the DAO's governance and our long term goals:\n\n1) Significantly reduces Sybil and other attack vectors in off-chain governance proposals\n2) Ensures that participants are aligned with the long-term goals of the DAO and our vision\n3) Incentivizes governance participation with boosted yields\n4) Will be the main driver of the Liquidity Incentives Program 2.0 with community-governed incentives allocation and DEX-agnostic TVL growth\n5) Generates recurring revenue and treasury diversification through DAO-owned liquidity\n\n**Liquidity Gauges**: A pre-determined amount of EVMOS tokens will be allocated towards Liquidity Incentives each month. veGOV weight from community participants will ultimately dictate the allocation of incentives for each liquidity pool. \n\nThrough the gauge system we are able to run our liquidity incentives program perpetually and in a much more decentralized, fair, and community-centric method. \n\n**Multi-Token Liquidity Mining**: Each pool's Gauge contract can distribute up to 5 different kinds of tokens. This allows for multiple partners/protocols/DAOs to incentivize a given pool by adding their own tokens. \n\nThe goal of the Liquidity Guages is to be as permissionless and community-governed as possible. However, the Governance Council may blacklist tokens from being able to be deposited as an incentivization token to combat spam.\n\n**Liquidity Vaults (Lockers)**: DAO-owned liquidity vaults (farms) will be deployed to maintain our stance of neutrality and allow the natural growth and healthy competition between DEXs and DeFi protocols. \n\nIn an effort to facilitate the steady growth of Evmos' TVL and liquidity, incentives will be boosted for those who commit to a bonding period when depositing their LP tokens. Auto-compounding contracts will also be deployed and utilized to maximize the yield for depositors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KcoDXpG.png)\n\n**Current Problem**: While Prop 64 provided the Evmos network the much needed native liquidity, the proposal was not designed to be a long-term solution. The TVL that has been built is held hostage by the high farming APRs provided at the expense of the Community Pool. The lack of any lockup mechanism also encourages \"pool hopping\" leading to potentially volatile liquidity and subsequently volatile price movements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4ScBYt4.png)\n\n \n### deGOV: Governance Rewards for Network Decentralization Assistance\n\nDelegated GOV tokens, or deGOV are similar to veGOV in that they hold voting weight. However, while veGOV is deflationary once received, deGOV gains voting weight the longer they are staked with the DAO. deGOV tokens are minted at a 1:2 ratio, meaning a 10 GOV deposit will return 5 deGOV.\n\ndeGOV does not have a maximum time-lock period, but will stop accruing voting power at 24 months, with a voting weight boost of 2x of the original deposit. The minimum bonding time is one month,\n\n**The Perpetual Bounty Fund**\n\ndeGOV will play a key role in the maintaining the sustainability of the Community Perpetual Bounty Fund. The concept of the Perpetual Bounty Fund straightforward - the DAO participates in network staking for the purpose of creating a self-replenishing fund for bounties, contributor payments, and special initiatives. \n\n- The authz module is utilized to re-stake “maintenance” token amounts to offset the daily changing APR.\n- A portion of the daily rewards (TBD) are sent to a claiming contract in which deGOV holders may wish to claim their share of the staking rewards.\n- The remainder of the rewards are claimed and sent back into a DAO treasury wallet used for bounties and funding initiatives. \n- If the bounty fund's growth is far exceeding the pace of outbound funds, the DAO may choose to re-route the funds to another program or into the Strategic Reserve fund.\n\nBounties can range from internal growth initiatives to external outreach campaigns. An internal growth example would be to bounty out a SourceCred deployment on Evmos to incentivize participation in governance, encourage constructive discussions, nurture a culture of helping others, etc. The potential bounties and programs can also act as an assistance tool for the core devs by contributing in areas like the improvement and expansion of the Evmos documentation. \n\nAs we eagerly wait for our community to grow and have leaders step up in the creation of new workstreams, bounties are an excellent tool to not only lighten the already heavy workload, but to attract talent, long-term contributors, and future leaders.\n\n**Delegation Gauges**: Similar to Liquidity Gauges, the community will have the power to decide the allocation amounts for 75% of the delegateable tokens from the Perpetual Bounty Fund. The Governance Council, although unlikely to happen often, reserves the right to decide the monthly delegation amounts of the remaining 25%.\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is restricted from delegating to any validator in the top 25 by VP, calculated at the last day of each month. Any votes towards the top 25 validators will be disregarded and allocations distributed proportionately to the eligible validators.  \n\n### yGOV: Yield Bearing Single-Sided Staking Rebase Tokens\n\nYield bearing GOV (or yGOV) are obtained by depositing GOV into an escrow contract controlled by the DAO. **yGOV does not have any voting weight.**\n\nyGOV is a rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with GOV. EVMOS tokens that are represented by the deposited GOV will be deployed into the network's DeFi ecosystem to generate optimized yields. The rebasing occurs shortly after every Evmos epoch and the yields are transferred directly to the users. This allows the constant accural of yields without the need for any action from the end user. \n\nThe redemption (unbonding) time for yGOV is 15 days. Instant withdrawals may be possible depending on the reserve liquidity available at that the time, but will incur a harsh 25% penalty fee. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R48AOko.png)\n\n\n**Liquidity Reserve**: A small reserve liquidity for the yGOV<>GOV swap contract will be maintained for those who are in an emergency and willing to incur the penalty fee.\n\n**yvGOV (Yield-Bearing Vested GOV)** is another GOV deriviative that is being researched. yvGOV will be a vested version of yGOV, with similar characteristics of veGOV. \n\n## Treasury Bonds Market\n\nProtocol owned liquidity (POL) is an important topic that is constantly brought up as one of the most important aspects of growing a healthy treasury. While POL is mostly used in the context of DeFi protocols' and product/service DAOs' treasuries, Evmos DAO is unique in that we are serving a community of an entire Layer-1 Blockchain. Thus, we feel justified in using the term \"Community Owned Liquidity.\" Just as we defend the integrity of the Evmos Constitution and our Governance System, we must fight to defend the value of our network. \n\n**Benefits of Community Owned Liquidity**\n\n- Diversification of Assets\n- Revenue Generation from Swap Fees\n- Long-term Aligned Ecosystem Growth\n- Stable Network-Wide Liquidity\n\n[WIP]\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":2491,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:32:35.427Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\\n\\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \\n\\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\\n\\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \\n - Community-governed incentives program\\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\\n\\n\\n## Motivation \\n\\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \\n\\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\\n\\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \\n\\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\\n\\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \\n\\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\\n\\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\\n\\n\\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\\n\\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\\n\\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \\n\\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\\n\\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \\n\\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\\n\\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \\n\\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\\n\\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \\n\\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\\n\\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \\n\\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\\n\\n\\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\\n\\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 606,000 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 300,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 600,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,831,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles.
