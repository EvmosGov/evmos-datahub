Comment for other amounts.\n\nDistribution: TBD.\n\n## Summary of Facts\n\n- go-ethereum is the de-facto library that implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\n- Ethereum core devs are continuously [improving](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) and [refining](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540) the EVM, which benefits Evmos too.\n- currently, 516 chains use EVM: https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains/tree/master/_data/chains\n- as far as I am aware, there are no official proposals from other chains' communities to reward the go-ethereum team for their work (not counting Ethereum itself, of course).\n- I understand that the go-ethereum team was included in the initial Evmos rektdrop, but I do not have information about actual numbers or people included, or whether anyone claimed the airdropped tokens.\n\n## What Does Evmos Stand to Gain?\n\nThe Evmos Community has the opportunity to lead by example and establish a mode of collaboration between chains based on clearly recognizing the effort and ideas that it uses. This proposal rewards the effort that has made Evmos itself possible.\n\nIt is to Evmos's benefit to have a good relationship with the creators and maintainers of the EVM engine. Even if Evmos decides to maintain and develop its own types of EVM(s).\n\nAdditionally: Evmos will benefit if Ethereum will accept and adopt its innovations such as:\n- the framework for adding precompiles ([Federico's work](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272))\n- the framework for stateful precompiles ([my work](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26119))\n\n\n## Proposal Lead\n\nI have been volunteering for Ethereum since 2018. My contribution is described in detail [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/Ethereum.md) - I am an author of EIPs, a functional language for EVM: Taylor, a visual language for EVM: Pipeline, presented at conferences and many other projects in the Ethereum space.\n\nIn Evmos, I was elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office [Evmos Governance proposal #45](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/45) and I have been contributing to Evmos (code, prototypes, innovations, video demos, governance) as a self-funded volunteer from The Laurel Project.

Galxe team proposes allocating $300K USD in EVMOS to fund targeted campaigns and initiatives that provides Evmos with exposure to new users and drives organic growth on-chain. Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so. These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well. With a large portion of the Rektdrop being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.\n\nThese funds will be sent to a multisig comprised of Evmos community members and the Galxe team to ensure accountability for the distribution of funds. (TBD)\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nMotivation\n\nGalxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users. Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)\n\nDiffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:\n\nFollowing socials (Twitter/Discord)\n\nRetweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet\n\nMake a swap\n\nProvide liquidity\n\nBuy an NFT and hold for X amount of time\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem\n\nIntroduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses to the Evmos ecosystem\n\nIntroduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing powerJoint AMA’s\n\nBlog post\n\nRetweets\n\nQuote Tweets\n\nTweets all throughout the campaign\n\nDiscord/Telegram communication\n\nCampaign featured on our main carousel [see: https://galxe.com/campaigns ]\n\nEngage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem\n\nEducate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns\n\nProblems a Galxe campaign addresses\n\nStagnant growth to the ecosystem\n\nLack of new users\n\nAbsence of engagement\n\nLow exposure\n\nValue that Galxe can add\n\nDrive new, quality users into the ecosystem from a new web3 audience that Evmos has not had exposure to yet\n\nIncrease TVL and transaction volume on Evmos for long term growth\n\nDiscord and Twitter tools to engage off chain\n\nOn chain tools to create on chain loyalty programs\n\nPast experience with similar campaigns that include Arbitrum, Solana, Optimism, and Moonbeam\n\nBring users from other EVM and non EVM chains to the ecosystem\n\nConvert new users into long term, loyal users of the Evmos ecosystem\n\nExperts in on chain and off chain growth\n\nStrong marketing power and exposure from Galxe’s socials and network\n\nTwitter : 504K+ (Verified)\n\nDiscord : 295K +\n\nCo Marketing Galxe can provide:\n\nJoint AMA’s\n\nBlog post\n\nRetweet\n\nQuote Tweet\n\nTweets all throughout the campaign\n\nDiscord/Telegram communication\n\nCampaign featured on our main carousel [see: https://galxe.com/campaigns ]\n\nOverall ask and where the funds will go\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nThe overall ask is for Evmos to put together an ecosystem campaign on Galxe similar to the likes of the Optimism Quest, Solana’s “2022 is gonna be Sol Cool”, Arbitrum Odyssey, and Moonbeam’s Ultimate Harvest Moon Campaign'' all hosted and coordinated by Galxe. The funds allocated to this campaign will go to the community members who participate in this campaign and not to Galxe. A scoring system will be put in place for the users who collect all or the majority of badges throughout the campaign. The more NFTs you collect the more you will be rewarded.\n\nhttps://galxe.com/polygon/campaign/GCNWwUwJBT\n\nTwitter Space Credential Badges claimed after attending a Twitter Space\n\nhttps://galxe.com/ZetaChain/campaign/GCcGZUtnHZ\n\nTwitter/Discord Credential 169K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://galxe.com/HopProtocol/campaign/GCmydUtumN\n\nNFT for bridging ETH over to Arbitrum 240K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GChMBUtwGc\n\nNFTs for swapping into specific tokens with a minimum $USD on ODOS DEX 516K+ NFTs Minted\n\nhttps://docs.galxe.com/case-studies/DEXGrowthWithHashflow\n\nHashflow DEX Case Study On chain growth from 3,000 - 13,000+ users in 6 weeks\n\nTrading volume went from $19.8M - $673M in 6 weeks\n\nhttps://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6HiUtSAs\n\nStargate Bridge Campaign in Optimism Quest 60K+ NFTs Minted\n\nAbout Galxe\n\nIn 2021, Galxe was formed by Bullet Labs and has seen substantial growth on numerous fronts. Charles Wayn and Harry Zhang co-founded Galxe and previously founded the blockchain streaming service, DLive, where they successfully exited in 2019 after a sale to BitTorrent.\n\nSince inception, Galxe has raised $10M from top VC funds around the globe, had an oversubscribed public sale on CoinList, and launched the $GAL token in May on the majority of tier 1 CEX’s which included Binance and Coinbase on the first day. Their latest financing round was led by Dragonfly and Multicoin Capital . Most recently, Galxe was awarded the 2022 Binance Launchpool Project of The Year Award.\n\nGalxe has extensive experience in putting together ecosystem campaigns and has delivered superior results for each ecosystem we’ve partnered with. Running an ecosystem campaign on Galxe comes with incredible co-marketing opportunities that include Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Joint AMA’s, Blog post, and Campaigns featured on our main carousel.\n\nPrevious Ecosystem Campaigns\n\nSolana’s “2022 is Sol Cool” Campaign\n\nSolana’s ecosystem added 33,400 new users with each unique user trying an average of 5 protocols on Solana and 4,826 users completing 10 or more tasks from different partners.\n\nCampaign page views for duration of campaign: 1,233,416\n\nUsers (unique visitor for duration of campaign): 336,313\n\nNFT Minted: 130,503\n\n**Blog post by Galxe: **https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-presents-2022-is-gonna-be-sol-cool-6445c43a942c\n\n**Case Study: **https://docs.galxe.com/case-studies/EcosystemGrowthWithSolana\n\nGalxe Blog Post for Solana Campaign: https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-presents-2022-is-gonna-be-sol-cool-6445c43a942c\n\n(image)\n\nArbitrum Odyssey\n\nCampaign page views until 10/13/2022: 2,256,041\n\nUsers (unique visitor): 394,992\n\nNFT Minted 420,401 until pause for Nitro (Arbitrum network upgrade) one week in\n\nBlog post by Galxe: https://blog.galxe.com/project-galaxy-teams-up-for-arbitrum-odyssey-104e07edcdc9\n\nCampaign page: https://galxe.com/arbitrum/campaign/GCCNzUtQiW\n\nOptimism Quest\n\nCampaign page views until 11/08/2022: 1,010,701\n\nUsers (unique visitor): 64,938\n\nNFT Minted 553,524 to date\n\nBlog post by Galxe: https://blog.galxe.com/galxe-x-optimism-optimism-quests-f060c139d660\n\nCampaign Page: https://galxe.com/Optimism/campaign/GC6xiUtedg\n\nStargate transactions after beginning the OP Quest (graphic taken on 9/21)\n\n(image)\n\n(image)\n\nGalxe + OP Twitter Spaces Announcement Tweet\n\n(image)\n\nThe Ultimate Harvest Moon Campaign (Moonbeam)\n\nCampaign page views from 7/28 - 8/11: 214,287\n\nUsers (unique visitor): 48,376\n\nNFT Minted: 41,567\n\nCampaign is paused because of the Nomad hack on Moonbeam\n\nBlog post by Galxe:\n\nhttps://blog.galxe.com/the-ultimate-harvest-moon-campaign-97d41c5d2f48\n\nCampaign Page: https://galxe.com/Moonbeam/campaign/GCcg1Ut2hD\n\nGalxe Twitter announcement tweet of Moonbeam campaign\n\n(image)\n\nFunding Request\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\nGalxe is requesting a rewards pool of $300K USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members. We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign. Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.\n\nThe campaign structure would typically be throughout a number of weeks depending on how many dApps participate. The community can always be extended and more dApps can join in. Users will complete simple on-chain and off-chain tasks on each dapp such as Twitter/Discord actions and swapping, farming, staking, bridging, LP, etc. Evmos can choose to pick the participating dApps itself or can allow the community to vote and choose the participating dApps. The campaign can be structured in the two following ways:\n\nThroughout the duration of the campaign users will have the ability to engage with two dApps per week and the following week an additional two dApps will become available for users to engage with. Arbitrum is operating their quest like this and we’ve seen success with this structure.\n\nAll dApps part of the quest will be available for users to engage with throughout the duration of the campaign. Optimism is operating their quest like this. This could be useful for DeFi protocols if you want users to stake or provide liquidity for a month or longer\n\nGaxle has the ability to implement sybil prevention credentials to make sure rewards are not diluted to bots and users with multiple wallets. We currently have the following credentials available\n\nhttps://galxe.com/credential/207415643290116096\n\nHas at least 30 transactions on Ethereum mainnet after Ethereum Merge\n\nhttps://galxe.com/credential/187770474584514560\n\nHas at least 10 transaction on Ethereum mainnet\n\nWe have the ability to set up credentials that include hold X (.1, .25, .5) amount of ETH on Ethereum\n\nWe’re excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with the Evmos community, and leverage our current user base to help with the on-chain growth of the ecosystem. We encourage feedback from the community to ensure we’ve addressed any questions or concerns, so we gain resounding support for this proposal.\n\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.","kind":"link","stage":"discussion","url":"https://bulletlabs.notion.site/bulletlabs/Evmos-Ecosystem-Campaign-by-Galxe-8ba3afc4f96b43eb9e58fe76fed51b2d","topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-10T00:09:09.174Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos189hq9d0ycvmtc9npwluhmfupm747p038m3l3ua\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Galxe\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-09T22:14:12.680Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-10T00:09:09.182Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T16:46:14.633Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-17T16:46:14.633Z","Address":{"id":70630,"address":"evmos189hq9d0ycvmtc9npwluhmfupm747p038m3l3ua","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-12T01:24:06.965Z","keytype":null,"name":"Galxe","last_active":"2022-11-14T15:24:47.275Z","user_id":66436,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":63718,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":66436},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1160,"name":"3.

Mu Kim @ov#1111\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe're showcasing our first dApp on EVMOS here: https://lowkeys.io/\n\nEVMOS is a breakthrough in every way, engineering the most difficult problems with innovative token designs and structured community governance. We are following the foothold to build a new ecosystem of physical assets on EVMOS. To unlock them, we need community-led initiatives to seamlessly connect the assets to the tokens. We are stepping into a new era that brings real world utilities into the tokens and making the analog and digital inseparable.\n\nWe introduce on-chain governance for physical asset acquisition, starting with contemporary artworks. The community votes on the piece to acquire and the protocol issues fractionalize Alternative Asset (fALT) tokens to represent equity share of the asset. This is akin to the issuance model of Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, tapping into the real world assets to be used for daily crypto users.\n\nThe Road to EVMOS subDAO\n\nWe ask the community to think about our integration into EVMOS as subDAO, focusing on Web 2.0 users acquisition and onboarding physical assets into the ecosystem. The ethos for decentralization and the logos \"disband-distribute-create\" model are what unite us together. We will build the killer dApp as the powerhouse of Cosmos together.\n\nWe have been thinking and understanding the nuances with subDAO by talking with the EVMOS team. We envision the chemistry between Olympus DAO and Redacted. Both have their own token and different BMs, but conduct towards the same goal under the OHM's ecosystem. They're intertwined with each other's tokens, so it becomes a trustless bond. This is what we will become with EVMOS. In the past months, we've realized that having the community support is much more reliable and more grounded in the direction we're headed for decentralization.\n\nThe proposal we outline here is having accountability and consequences and actually being invested both ways to grow and go beyond with the tokens. Our vision is to streamline the other EVMOS subDAOs to follow our framework when entering in as a subDAO to have a trustless recourse to consequences. Though our token will track the protocol / dApp growth specifically similar to a specific ERC20 token tracks growth of its own protocol rather than the entire L1 economy. If we think the EVMOS economy is undervalued as a whole, we should want to own more EVMOS. If we think people are undervaluing ALT growth specifically, we should increase more exposure to ALT. It's the exact same dynamic of whether we would invest in a specific project or we invest in EVMOS instead. If we think the EVMOS economy as a whole is undervalued, you'd buy more EVMOS. But if we think Renaissance will grow faster than the sum total of the economy, we'll want to own that specific token rather than the EVMOS. It's important to note that the protocol growth accrues value back to EVMOS, not just to one token because we're built upon EVMOS and people have to use EVMOS to use our dApp. The EVMOS ecosystem grows with us growing as separate tokens.\n\nAlignment\n\nEVMOS is particularly interesting in the gas fee split. When Renaissance Labs record the fractionalized shares and transactions on a decentralized ledger, there’s no incentive for us to use a particular network. However, the gas fee split effectively incentivizes us to keep EVMOS as our backbone when on-boarding Web 2 users with a seamless UI / UX. While partaking in the fees, we’re further impelled to develop the ecosystem to increase our asset value.\n\nLet’s look at this from another logical sequence - there are very few ecosystems with growing TVL and users like EVMOS in this market. It’s safe to say that EVMOS has found the product-market fit between the users and the network. We’re particularly excited for the next cycles for new ideas to flow into EVMOS and Cosmos to integrate fALTs as building blocks of the protocols.\n\nHACKAtom 2022 in Seoul was the turning point for Renaissance Labs. We were mesmerized by the intellectual curiosity of the builders and support for us. As a new chain, we need more dApps to increase the utility of EVMOS and attract users to the ecosystem with a killer dApp. We are building the dApps at a pace no one has seen.\n\nWhy EVMOS?\n\nWhen Noi mentioned the gas split during HackATOM, we were shocked. How didn’t anyone think of this? Again, the gas split is a major incentive for us to keep building on EVMOS.\n\nWe believe in trade-offs, but there are none here. ETH is great for tapping into liquidity sources, but the transaction finalization speed is not up to the standard of an everyday Web 2.0 user. To onboard Instagram and Tik Tok users, we had to find a network that has an unnoticeable transaction finalization.\n\nAdding on to the second point, the cheap gas fees and fast transactions create a value proposal for our users who want both. Let’s take Solana. Solana has an exceptional user experience capturing both, but no incentive for us to build upon it.\n\nVision\n\nThe problem we see today is that the lack of initiatives to onboard Web 2.0 users to dApps. Most of the apps are focused on the decentralization; hence, the scope of variations and developments can only be subtle when we only have a limited set of building blocks bound by pure decentralization. Tokenized physical assets create a new medium of value transfer on Cosmos.\n\nWhy Do Physical or Real-World Assets Matter?\n\nDeFi is mostly stable coins, swaps, lending and derivatives, limited by the number of the building blocks. Real-world asset on-chain increase the number of DeFi lego blocks to grow the market size and the users with higher stability and growth.\n\nThe global financial value mostly derives from real world assets. For example, the global real estate market has $360 trillion , and gold has $11 trillion market capitalization. Think about unlocking the values tied with the real world assets on-chain with DeFi incentives. Let’s take USDC for example. The yields from USDC outperformed Aave and Compound in the last year. Another example would be Synthetix - a dApp that offers on-chain exposure to fiat currency, commodities and stocks through synthetic cryptocurrencies, locking up to $3 billion worth of assets in the protocol at its peak.\n\nTaking this notion further, we believe that tokenizing world-class physical assets can be beneficial for a multitude of reasons.\n\nFor the artists:\n\nLowering the barrier of entry for their artwork whilst expanding their consumer base. Rather than one individual owning a valuable asset, multiple people can have partial ownership of the asset for the portion they own whilst maintaining the integrity of the physical asset and the transaction fees introduce a new income stream for the artist. i.e. people would rather own a piece of the Mona Lisa over another one of Da Vinci’s artwork.\n\nArt in its purest form is subjective and difficult to be made proprietary. The global art market was estimated to be worth around US$405 billion in 2021 and rapidly growing, and with the advance in technology, gives rise for more. However, with the use of blockchain technology, fALT tokens can act as underlying assets - much like financial derivatives - and can also verify the authenticity and ownership of the assets.\n\nfALT can also be gamified through token ownership. Artists can impose certain benefits and perks for holding a minimum threshold of <1 fALT, further increasing the value of their collection.\n\nFor the consumers:\n\nLike financial derivatives, fALT will bring a wave of new investors to trade in this new asset class. We have already seen the huge success of $GMX and $SNX on Arbitrum and there’s still plenty room to grow given the size of the current derivatives market. Indices, ETFs and vaults are just a few examples of the benefits of fALTs.\n\nHolding <1 fALT can also give consumers access to utilities that are gated from the public, much like how NFT passes/POAPs/tickets are used today. This design is fluid and dynamic and stems from the original collection instead of launching multiple collections.\n\nWhy Do We Need Funding?\n\nContract audit has been the financial hurdle for us. We create large and intricate projects, and the auditing fees come hefty. We will not release until we have audits from accredited professionals. The scope of each milestone in the roadmap requires around $150-200K. We have budgeted the annual budget (re-audit of the existing ones) to $800K / year.\n\nWorld-class team recruitment for faster execution. We live everyday like HackATOM, but there’s still a lot left on the table. We need reliable team members with great execution speed. The majority of the funding will be sorely used to acquire talent to build on EVMOS.\n\nWe deal with world-class physical assets, and this comes with another budget that‘s different from development. We will safeguard the assets in a state-of-the-art facility with insurance. The monitoring of the assets will be fully accessible 24/7 by the community. One can argue this is a more centralized approach, but we have chosen the faster execution and user acquisition, while forgoing negligible amount of decentralization in storage process. (Who can say USDC failed because it has centrality?) Also, the tokens are legally represented as shares of the assets under South Korea’s legislation, not securities. We’ve worked relentlessly to figure this one out, so rest be assured that the fALT holders are legally protected to claim the physical assets, even if Renaissance Labs were to disappear tomorrow.\n\nSummary\n\nRenaissance Labs is requesting the support for the launch on EVMOS and $3 million in EVMOS from the EVMOS community pool to fund, develop and bring physical assets on-chain and onboard Web 2.0 users. For comparison, this is less than the total funding request for Phase 1 of the new Governance Council Workstreams for the 6 months currently proposed, and we have the beta ready. We will be build the core DeFi infrastructure faster and safer than any team in the ecosystem. Please note that EVMOS will NOT be released until we meet the milestones.\n\nTo reiterate, the requested EVMOS will be released as we meet each milestone . The team will use these resources to grow our dedicated development team, so we can work toward our commitments and responsibilities necessary to create and maintain a decentralized physical asset storage.\n\nTo align both the community’s incentives and bind ourselves to the commitments, we’ll be transferring 10% of the total ALT tokens to the community pool . The EVMOS community can partake in the governance and have the tokens as a guarantee from Renaissance Labs. We’re incentivized to retrieve the ALT for EVMOS tokens back to the community pool and flywheel the ecosystem onboarding for teams like us. We have obligations to our backers and will to EVMOS community once this proposal has passed.\n\nWe have a DAO backer, Frax Finance , and an institutional backer, Lyrik Capital . The seed round with the two valued our token at $10M.\n\nThe valuation has increase to $30M because we found a product market fit with MVP-0 testing. We currently have a conversion rate of 9.88% from the most minimally viable product with only paid marketing. 36.40% of the users come to checkout an artwork and 12.10% create an account with us (this is huge feat, compared to any other new apps). As a comparable study, Circle raised $9 million in Series A at $90M valuation for Series A and Masterworks raised $110M at $890M valuation for Series A.\n\n(image)\n\nEVMOS from the Community Pool will be returned in Series A or B. However, if the community feels aligned with the direction of the dApp and want to diversify the treasury. We’ll follow the community’s decision.\n\n💡 The 10% of the total ALT tokens will not be diluted, as we have a maximum number of tokens and will only be sold at or above the current valuation, only at the community’s approval. Also, we’re committed to buyback our tokens with EVMOS within the next 4 years.\n\nAlternative (ALT) Token\n\nALT token is the governance token; it is the base token of all our dApps to come, accruing value as we bringing in more physical assets on-chain and increase usage on the EVMOS ecosystem. We have an innovation in our tokens: buybacks. ALT can only be obtained via airdrops by participating in fALT sales after the launch or purchasing them directly from the protocol. The tokens bought via protocol have a cliff to be obtained at a higher price point if all the tokens available at previous cliff are purchased. Not only that we avert the downside pressure for the token, but also ALT will share the revenues from the sales of the artworks, lending, and indices.\n\nThe tokens purchased to participate in the on-chain voting rounds to select the artwork or artist the community wishes to onboard. The voters will have a rated discount on the purchases of that round. Also, the creator of indices must burn ALT tokens. The design of the protocol is that ALT would be deflationary in supply as the tokens are burned from utilization.\n\nThe following is our token distribution:\n\n(image)\n\nContext\n\nMotivation\n\nRenaissance Labs started in late 2021 as an NFT fractionalization protocol. The NFT craze in the last bull cycle drew an interesting picture. Seeing how the NFT investors left the market after the downturn, we can deduce that they weren’t particularly fond of the value proposition of Web 3.0. People came in for the opportunity to make a quick buck in a new and fastest rising asset class. What we found particularly interesting was that NFTs have turned everyday investors into collectors. Unfortunately, most of the NFTs did not have any utility nor the community to survive the market and gradually faded away\n\nNFTs were mirroring the innate desires to collect non-fungible assets, represent its community and derive value. Then, why don’t we bring the investment-grade collectible in the real-world on-chain? This is where we come in. USDC and USDT have shown a proven and centralized issuance model, where a redeemable token representing the actual asset, removes the need for the intermediary, whilst being fast and customizable on-chain.\n\nWe’re embracing the same model for physical assets, starting with contemporary artworks. We transparently disclose the information on the location, condition and authenticity with professional curators and appraisers with tens of years of experience. Circle’s fast-growing success was largely based on the transparency over its competitor, USDT, and that’s us.\n\nFractionalized Alternative Asset (fALT) are the tokenized shares of the physical assets, verified and stored by Renaissance Labs, starting with contemporary art. Each asset is insured and legally protected, so you don’t have to worry about any mishaps.\n\nCreating a killer dApp for Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 users alike is difficult. The product that fits into both categories involve a tint of centralization and a UX journey that’s attractive and fast. There’s not been an initiative to promote the network usage as EVMOS did with the dApp Store. We’ve found a product that facilitates large amounts of transactions, attractive enough for Web 2.0 users accustomed to paid marketing, while sustaining every aspect of DeFi in every vein of the dApp.\n\nProposer\n\nRenaissance Labs is an entity in South Korea, whose goal is to issue tokens representing shares of the artworks and the largest $ALT holder at start to flywheel the curation process. Renaissance Labs has expertise in building the core infrastructure and scaling dApps for EVMs and EVMOS. We were the first place in 2022 HackATOM - EVMOS Track and the first place in ETHSeoul.\n\nJung Mu Kim is a Cornell University graduate and the founder of Renaissance DAO - NFT fractionalization protocol. He’s responsible for scaling a team and designing the protocol / tokenomics. He worked at Samsung Electronics as a AI researcher, responsible for developing random walk and product pricing algorithms. After Samsung, Jung had run a marketing agency for 3 years. He’s experienced with financing / budgeting for the team, growing businesses and apps, and running the operations at a global scale.\n\nSung Rae Kim is a full-stack engineer with 10 years of software development experience. He is responsible for the development of solidity contracts. Working at Toss — the multi-billion startup in South Korea for developing an app loved by everyone — as a full-stack dev and Donable — a donation after service app — as the CTO, he was responsible for architectural design and app development for Web 2 and 3 users. He has a solid solidity background (no pun intended) from contributing in LiquidDAO, KlayCash, HelloChain for the past 3 years.\n\nJae Hyun Lee is a RISD graduate and CEO of Geomang Creative Studio, an artist agency in South Korea. He’s been an independent painter, creating and curating artworks for major exhibitions. He’s responsible for onboarding artists for Renaissance Labs. He has sourced exclusive works from Eun Jin Kim, Dew Kim and Jeong Ui Yun. Geomagnetic Creative Studio is one of the most wanted gallery and artist agency by contemporary artists.\n\nVasariDAO is an extension of Renaissance Labs that offers deep dives and curations of the artworks and onboarding artists. Deeply grounded by decentralization, the DAO selects an artist to onboard with on-chain voting and releasing their works on-chain as NFTs or fractionalizing them on Renaissance Labs.\n\nGovernance Votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal. All addresses that vote on the proposal might be eligible for a future airdrop.\n\nYES : You approve the proposal statements and distribute the amount of $3M in EVMOS to the multisig address and receive 30,000,000 ALT (10% of the total supply) to the Community Fund treasury. The treasury will allocate the funds to the Renaissance Labs team, leading the core development efforts and supporting the dApp’s go-to-market strategy. It will also lead to core technology maintenance and continuous discussion to ensure the project’s longevity.\n\nNO : The NO vote is a request for improvements or adjustments. You agree that this proposal’s motivation is valuable and that the team should create a follow-up proposal once the amendments are included.\n\nNO (VETO) : You veto the entire motivation for the proposal and expect the core team and current maintainers to make the determination and continue the stewardship of the project. The proposers will not create a follow-up proposal.\n\nABSTAIN : You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.\n\nMultisig and release of funds\n\nUpon the approval of the proposal, the treasury will distribute the funds to a ⅔ multi-signature account managed by the following individuals/partners:\n\nJung Mu Kim - Renaissance Labs (Proposer)\n\nTricky or LPX - EVMOS\n\n1 Community Member\n\nThe account address is: 0x16182E0d7Ba52764A982552DfDdFDe8519feE7DF\n\nIf the proposal passes, the team will immediately receive 40% of the funds to expand its engineering team, artwork acquisition team and other business development efforts to support GTM for the dApp. The remaining 60% will be released in an equal proportion to the number of milestones upon the completion of each milestone. For any reason, if the proposer has not completed the next milestone within a year of the last payment, the remaining funds held in the multisig account will be returned to the community pool.\n\nProduct commitment\n\nThe current proposal aims to develop all the necessary components for a successful tokenization of contemporary artworks. Our team will lead the core development efforts to execute the points below.\n\nHard Commitments\n\nThese are the items that are mandatory for the release of funds. The items will be split into four milestones. We expect to complete all the milestones within the year of launch. Yes, we work fast.\n\nMilestone 1: $ALT and $fALT Launch\n\nThis milestone is to distribute $ALT in a launch and flywheel the $fALT distribution with on chain governance to select the desired artworks by the community. The following are the tech specs required:\n\nALTToken (ERC20): ALT Token native to EVMOS\n\nfALTToken (ERC20)\n\nwfALTToken (ERC20)\n\nfALTSale: Used for the first sales of fALT\n\nALTDrop: ALT Token air-dropped in accordance to fALT purchase amount\n\nBuyback : Buying back the ALT token at specified price with respective cliff. More details are outlined in the tokenomics.\n\nVote : On-chain governance on artworks yet to be sourced. If the vote is successful, the voters will receive 10% discount on the offerings.\n\nLiquid-Wrapper : Wrapping ownership-sharing fALT Tokens into liquid wfALTToken. The Korean government dictates that the fALT tokens are actual representation of the underlying asset. Therefore, we designed a whitelisting process for the fALT token to not fall under any third party outside the interest of artwork sales. The liquid-wrapper allows the underlying fALT tokens to remain in the protocol until the artwork sale and the wrapped tokens to trade without governance over the sales.\n\nALT Airdrop: $ALT will be airdropped to EVMOS holders and fALT purchasers. The ALT drop amount will increase in respect to the amount of fALTs purchased.\n\nALT Initial Offering: Sale of $ALT tokens with price increase cliffs at the number of tokens sold.\n\nBridge: Bridge between ETH and EVMOS for ALT, fALT, wfALT.\n\nDocumentation: Ensure the documentations for both ALT and fALT contracts are up to date with the implementation. The team will create an in-depth how-to videos and articles to navigate through the dApp.\n\n(image)\n\nMilestone 2: Sale of $5M artworks\n\nThis milestone aims to reach a stage where we have successfully implemented the on-chain governance, sourced the artworks for users to collect / invest on-chain and have allowed Web 2 users to use the dApp in what will feel like a seamless experience. Normally, startups have 20x revenue multiples. The valuation after completing this stage will be $100M.\n\nMulti-chain purchases: Users will be able to purchase artworks at the desired chains (e.g. ETH and BSC). We will send the fALTs into the same wallet only on EVMOS, thus flywheel EVMOS’ user acquisition further.\n\nDocumentation : Ensure the documentation for multi-chain purposes are up to date and provide a seamless experience for all chain users.\n\nArtwork acquisition : We acquire at least 50 reliable brokers to source investment-grade artworks all over the world. The artworks must be appreciated by professionals and acquired by Renaissance Labs if they can be acquired lower than the market price.\n\nArtwork Curation Videos : Each acquired artwork is carefully and professionally curated with videos to ensure the quality and condition of the piece. Regular JPEGs and PNGs may fail to capture the aura. The curation videos will be used to\n\nMetrics : We plan to transparently disclose relevant metrics on user engagement information such as the number of user acquisition and gas usage by the contracts. This will include a readable and clean UI in the form of charts.\n\nFiat on-ramp: We will work with EVMOS team to bring fiat on-ramps to EVMOS. We expect the fiat on-ramp to drastically increases the amount of transactions and users.\n\nWeb 2 User Guides: For Web 2 users, the user guide from Milestone must be updated. Using a Metamask or Keplr wallet is a treacherous journey for a new comer.\n\n(image)\n\nMilestone 3: Lending Protocol\n\nThis milestone is where our real plans begin to unveil. The lending facility allows for permission-less lending and debt origination with fALTs and other ERC-20s as collateral assets to EVMOS. The primary goal is to allow anyone to create a market between a pair of ERC-20 tokens at EVMOS. Any token with an oracle data feed can be used as collateral.\n\nLender: Lenders provide asset tokens in exchange for fTokens.\n\nBorrower: Borrowers provide fALT or other collateral tokens in exchange to receive Asset Tokens. Borrowing incurs an interest rate which is to be paid to the lenders upon the redemption of fALTs.\n\nOracle: Oracle for EVMOS to calculate the market price for the fALT and asset tokens.\n\nRate Calculator: The contracts give an interest rate based on the amount of available capital to borrow. With less borrowers, the rate will be higher and vice versa.\n\nArtwork Pricing Algorithm: We will build a proprietary pricing algorithm for artworks. The algorithms are used to allow the lenders to know which\n\nLoan-To-Value: The borrower will have a Loan-To-Vale (LTV) to represent the ratio between the loan and the collateral deposited. The LTV will decide the health range of the borrower’s position.\n\nLiquidator: When the borrower’s LTV is beyond the maximum LTV, liquidators can repay the debt for the borrower and receive the collateral with liquidation fees.\n\n(image)\n\nMilestone 4: Artist Index (fALTI)\n\nThis milestone’s objective is to create liquidity for the illiquid artworks by creating indices. fALTI is the liquidity aggregator for the illiquid artworks. It’s pegged to the basket of fALTs to track inflation and price variations of the assets held.\n\nThe creators of an artist index has a creator fee in perpetuity to incentivize third-parties to create new indices and receive trading fees by providing liquidity on a DEX. The indices aim to be on-chain value account of the basket of assets held.\n\nArtist-based Index: We will create an index token comprised of basket of the artists’ pieces. The creator of the index token will have to burn ALT to create the index and will be receive the origination fee in perpetuity until the community decides otherwise. The liquidity providers are able to accrue the trading fees.\n\nWhitelisting for Index: Only whitelisted assets will be able to added on to an index for the fALT. This is to ensure only the relevant assets are held into the index.\n\nAsset addition into index: fALTs whitelisted in the index token can be added to the index at anytime. The index grows in value of the fALT added into the index and mints new tokens to the user adding fALT. This allows the fALT owner to obtain instant liquidity through indices and index investors to have a hedging agent when investing into a more liquid basket, while also investing into an illiquid artwork alone.\n\nLiquidity Incentive: We plan to work with EVMOS team to create more liquid indices to allow the free trading of fALTs. EVMOS acquires more transactions and users, and Renaissance Labs further reaps the benefits of the dApp Store.\n\n(image)\n\nFunding\n\nRenaissance Labs commits to raising capital for $ALT to provide working capital for hiring talents and finding the right partners. We will work towards creating ties with institutions and commercial partners to further adoption of EVMOS ecosystem and the protocol.\n\nFor the higher valuation, this is how our MVP-0 is doing with just paid marketing. Our hypothesis here is \"Will people purchase fractionalized artworks that we curated?\" It's safe to say we found the product market fit with this conversion rate. The conversion rate fluctuates between high 9% to low 10%. Most of the users are buying around $100-$200 on a brand new app. We want to scale the app aggressively.\n\nCommunity and Governance\n\nThe stakeholders commit to develop and foster the EVMOS ecosystem. Renaissance Labs ensure that governance practices are intact to vote on treasury allocations, protocol parameters and seek for community feedbacks to implement new features and improvements.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith this proposal, Renaissance Labs seek the community’s support to expedite the Web 2 user and physical asset onboarding onto EVMOS. Renaissance Labs will create the killer dApps fully built on EVMOS to inter-operate with other Cosmos chains.\n\nThe roadmap is to ensure that the agendas of Renaissance Labs and EVMOS are aligned and the required funding is appropriate for each milestone in the eyes of the EVMOS community. Renaissance Labs is committed to bringing on a wave of new users and fair economic opportunities for all.\n\nTake a look at our website:\n\nhttps://lowkeys.io/","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":"","topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-04T14:33:05.254Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1zcvzurtm55nkf2vz25klmh77s5vlae7l4xwuua\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Jung Kim - Renaissance Labs\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Building the Renaissance\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-04T13:07:30.685Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Author\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nJung Mu Kim @ov#1111\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":2},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"We're showcasing our first dApp on EVMOS here:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://lowkeys.io/\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://lowkeys.io/\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" \\\\n\\\\nEVMOS is a breakthrough in every way, engineering the most difficult problems with innovative token designs and structured community governance.

Most of the apps are focused on the decentralization; hence, the scope of variations and developments can only be subtle when we only have a limited set of building blocks bound by pure decentralization. Tokenized physical assets create a new medium of value transfer on Cosmos.\\\\nWhy Do Physical or Real-World Assets Matter?\\\\nDeFi is mostly stable coins, swaps, lending and derivatives, limited by the number of the building blocks. Real-world asset on-chain increase the number of DeFi lego blocks to grow the market size and the users with higher stability and growth.\\\\nThe global financial value mostly derives from real world assets. For example, the global real estate market has \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.savills.com/impacts/market-trends/the-total-value-of-global-real-estate.html\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"$360 trillion\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\", and gold has \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"$11 trillion\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" market capitalization.

Rather than one individual owning a valuable asset, multiple people can have partial ownership of the asset for the portion they own whilst maintaining the integrity of the physical asset and the transaction fees introduce a new income stream for the artist. i.e. people would rather own a piece of the Mona Lisa over another one of Da Vinci’s artwork.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"ordered\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Art in its purest form is subjective and difficult to be made proprietary.

The NFT craze in the last bull cycle drew an interesting picture. Seeing how the NFT investors left the market after the downturn, we can deduce that they weren’t particularly fond of the value proposition of Web 3.0. People came in for the opportunity to make a quick buck in a new and fastest rising asset class. What we found particularly interesting was that NFTs have turned everyday investors into collectors. Unfortunately, most of the NFTs did not have any utility nor the community to survive the market and gradually faded away\\\\nNFTs were mirroring the innate desires to collect non-fungible assets, represent its community and derive value. Then, why don’t we bring the investment-grade collectible in the real-world on-chain? This is where we come in. USDC and USDT have shown a proven and centralized issuance model, where a redeemable token representing the actual asset, removes the need for the intermediary, whilst being fast and customizable on-chain.\\\\nWe’re embracing the same model for physical assets, starting with contemporary artworks. We transparently disclose the information on the location, condition and authenticity with professional curators and appraisers with tens of years of experience. Circle’s fast-growing success was largely based on the transparency over its competitor, USDT, and that’s us.\\\\n\\\\nFractionalized Alternative Asset (fALT) are the tokenized shares of the physical assets, verified and stored by Renaissance Labs, starting with contemporary art.

The product that fits into both categories involve a tint of centralization and a UX journey that’s attractive and fast. There’s not been an initiative to promote the network usage as EVMOS did with the dApp Store.

wide variety of web3 public goods (such as tools, plugins and educational content) provide necessary infrastructure essential to the growth of blockchain ecosystems.\n\nMost web3 public goods and open-source software rely on donations to fund their work. With the introduction of crypto, much has been done to complement the traditional donation process (i.e individuals and/or charities raise funds in order to donate to causes) including the introduction of crypto-based payments, quadratic funding, tokenized rewards to donors, etc.\n\nDespite these evolutions, donations are still made by giving money from your available capital to a public good. This results in an opportunity cost whereby donors forgo financial gain in favor of supporting a charity or cause. For smaller donors with lesser wealth, continuing to donate in this way may be more daunting as it relies on their ability to replenish their principal.\n\nThrough The Orb, we change this paradigm by introducing a novel way to fund web3 public goods. Instead of donating principal to public goods, donors allocate a portion of their yield from staked capital. This injects capital back into the ecosystem and enables donors to participate in a predictable, long-term manner.\n\nIn order to compensate for the donated yield, The Orb compounds yield to achieve a much higher APY. It also issues Orb governance tokens so donors get a say in which projects are funded, and awards donors with NFT, swag, etc. to channel natural reward/status seeking behavior into public goods.\n\nIn the prevailing staking model, proof-of-stake facilitates the extraction of financial value to stakers, but only provides limited mechanisms (e.g. restaking) to reinject value back into the ecosystem.\n\nThrough The Orb, stakers can provide essential support needed for the development of foundational technologies such as tools, plugins and educational content.\n\nDonating to these shared resources unlock enormous value as they accelerate adoption by making it easier to onboard developers, dapps and users. This in-turn redistributes value back to all stakeholders, creating a circular economy.\n\nIn this proposal we seek community support to set up The Orb and stake some of the Evmos community’s capital (currently locked by the foundation) through The Orb in order to bootstrap public goods funding within the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDefinition of a web3 public good\n\nThe traditional definition of a public good is a commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society. In web3, the definition of a public good is different. It consists of the following characteristics:\n\nHas longevity: It’s both achievable and indefinitely maintainable.\n\nCreates positive externalities: It benefits a larger audience and goes beyond an immediate set of users.\n\nIs universally accessible: It should be accessible to anyone in the world and is both free to use and open-source.\n\nExamples of public goods\n\nFoundry: A development tool to build Ethereum applications used by many thousands of developers ( https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry )\n\nPOAPs: NFT badges issued to commemorate events such as twitter spaces calls and hundreds of crypto conferences ( https://poap.gallery )\n\nDevpill.me : A community led blockchain development guide ( https://www.devpill.me/ )\n\nLenster: A decentralized, and permissionless social media app ( https://lenster.xyz )\n\nBloom Network: An international community of people and projects creating and nurturing regenerative cultures ( https://bloomnetwork.org/ )\n\nProject overview\n\nMany web3 public goods primarily rely on donations to fund their work. These include developer tools, plugins, extensions and educational content that are managed and maintained by millions of downstream contributors.\n\nGiven the importance of donations, much work has been done in web3 to facilitate the fundraising process. Platforms such as Giveth, Gitcoin and Protocol Guild amongst others have reorganized funding in web3 to be more efficient, transparent and rewarding to donors.\n\nNotable improvements include:\n\nIncreased opportunities for not-for-profit projects to receive donations in crypto\n\nOptimized distribution with seasonal funding rounds and better fund allocation methods such as matching grants, quadratic funding and vesting contracts\n\nImproved incentives through tokenizing contributions and offering donor rewards in the form of financial tokens and NFTs\n\nYet, little has been done to change the traditional model of donation. In the current model, donors incur an opportunity cost in order to support a cause, as they forgo future gains from their principal.\n\nThis can be challenging for many donors with lesser wealth, as it relies on their ability to replenish their principal in order to continue making donations.\n\nIn the prevailing staking model, proof-of-stake extracts financial value to stakers, without providing many mechanisms (aside from restaking) to reinject value back into the ecosystem.\n\nThrough The Orb, we change this paradigm by introducing a novel way to fund web3 public goods.\n\nDonors stake their capital, and allocate a portion of their gains to public goods. This injects capital back into the ecosystem in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nAs a result, donors don't diminish their principal, while participating in a predictable, long-term funding model for public goods.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nBy reinjecting yield into public goods, donors provide the essential support needed for the development of foundational technology such as tools, plugins and educational content that benefit the entire ecosystem continuously and effortlessly.\n\nThese shared resources unlock enormous value as they accelerate adoption by making it easier to onboard more developers, dapps and users.\n\nReinjecting yield from staked capital into an ecosystem redistributes value to all stakeholders, creating a circular economy.\n\nWen ATH? :)\n\n(image)\n\nHow it works\n\nUsers stake Evmos through The Orb Program. They can choose any validator, including any node they are already staking on.\n\nThe Orb program auto-compounds daily on behalf of the user (for a much higher ROI), allocates 15% to the public goods treasury and distributes the rest of the yield back to the user.\n\nFunds are allocated to public goods projects including the Orb, which retains a portion for operating, maintaining and growing the project.\n\nGovernance\n\nFor each Evmos token donated to public goods, donors receive governance tokens.\n\nFunds collected in The Orb Public Goods Treasury are managed by a DAO controlled by donors.\n\nThese tokens allow governance across 3 vectors:\n\nProposals and projects that would receive funding\n\nOrb strategic decisions (operations, fees, legal etc.)\n\nElecting and removing project vetting council members\n\nVision\n\nTo generate predictable, long-term funding for public goods, while securing blockchains and developing ecosystems.\n\nWebsite URL\n\nwww.stakeorb.xyz\n\nFees and Funding Structure\n\nAnyone can deploy funds to any Evmos node and receive 85% of the yield generated as a reward.\n\nThe balance 15%, will be allocated to The Orb public goods treasury.\n\nGovernance token holders will be able to vote on how the funds are allocated.\n\nReturns\n\nReturns will vary based on the block reward Evmos emission schedule. The current APY can be viewed here .\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nAttacks/Hacks on the ecosystem (blockchain, nodes, bridges, wallets, dapp etc.)\n\nDonating rewards to The Orb when liquid staking is introduced\n\nSlashing events\n\nNode downtime/jailing\n\nAbility to attract public goods\n\nTax concessions (in different jurisdictions)\n\nProject Selection\n\nThe public goods need to directly benefit the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nProjects must also fulfill the criteria set out in the public goods definition section.\n\nAll projects requesting funds and fund emission schedules are subject to approval by governance.\n\nRoadmap\n\nSetup public goods node (2 weeks): Setup the Evmos non-custodial yield optimization app.\n\nSetup The Orb DAO and multi-sig treasury (8 weeks): Setup The Orb DAO, the public goods multisig and The Orb foundation as a not-for-profit entity.\n\nToken airdrop contract (2 weeks): Issue governance tokens to donors.\n\nSetup public goods application process (12 weeks): Setup the applicant website and finalize the fund distribution mechanism.\n\nLaunch Orb grants season 1: Fund first public goods.\n\nTeam\n\nThe team behind The Orb consists of:\n\nSheran (@sheran_sc), Patrick (@iampotrok) and Sam (@samirxcv): Core contributors of Lighthouse DAO (@lighthouse_dao), a decentralized proof-of-contribution protocol for web3 reputation and credentialing. Currently working on bringing the Lighthouse protocol to Evmos.\n\nSebastien Couture (@seb3point0): Founder of Interop Ventures (@InteropVC), host of the Epicenter and The Interop podcasts, currently running Evmos Node “Interop”.\n\nWilliam Mougayar (@wmougayar): Early investor and advisory board member of the Ethereum Foundation, Executive Chairman, Kin Foundation.\n\nJean-Philippe Jabre (@jpjabre1): Founder of Plassa Capital and investor in the Jabcap Family Office interested in public goods funding mechanisms.\n\nRequests\n\n1. Request to channel existing locked capital by the Evmos Foundation through The Orb\n\nThe Evmos foundation recently staked approx. $10M Evmos on medium-sized nodes to promote network decentralization. We would like to explore the possibility of:\n\nRe-staking a portion of the existing delegation to the same mid-sized nodes through The Orb program.\n\nIssue a new delegation of $2M to 5M from the community pool to mid-sized nodes promoting further network decentralization through The Orb program.\n\nStaking through The Orb program has no impact on nodes, but it allocates 15% of the yield to the public goods treasury, which is controlled by Orb token holders.\n\nThe capital staked will not be accessible to us and will be owned by the Evmos community.\n\nThe exact request of funds will be decided based on the outcome of the poll attached to this discussion.\n\n2. Request for funds\n\n120,000 EVMOS vesting over 1 year to bootstrap The Orb foundation. These funds will be used to cover:\n\nDevelopment costs: The funds will be used to develop the non-custodial yield optimization app, token airdrop contracts, grant application process and associated website.\n\nMaintenance costs (during the bootstrap period): The funds will also be used to cover maintenance costs for a period of 1 year. These include patches and updates, monitoring, infrastructure costs etc associated with managing and maintaining Orb services. After 1 year, our goal is to fund this through The Orb DAO (subject to governance) which itself would be a public good.\n\nSetup costs related to The Orb Foundation: The funds will also be used to cover any setup costs including legal fees associated with setting up The Orb Foundation as a not-for-profit entity.\n\nFund allocation breakdown\n\n25% - At the start of the project\n\n50% - At the governance token airdrop event\n\n25% - At The Orb grants S1 launch\n\nFrequently Asked\n\n1. Which nodes will I be able to stake on?\n\nYou can stake on any Evmos node through The Orb program.\n\n2. Will The Orb be set up as a not-for-profit?\n\nYes.\n\n3. Will The Orb be run as an Evmos Workstream / Sub-DAO?\n\nWe are open to the idea! The specific mechanisms need to be discussed.\n\n4. What makes this better than traditional grants programs?\n\nWe purposefully designed The Orb to be a community-centric, egalitarian public good. It is very much a public good for public goods. In this way, our value proposition is what distinguishes us from other grants programs. We allow users and organizations to grow their capital while also creating a steady flow of capital towards a public goods treasury.\n\nThis process aligns incentives for all parties involved: donors/stakers, the public goods projects, The Orb, and the Evmos ecosystem. Furthermore, one-off donations are fleeting as they lack to establish a relationship between the donor and the cause. The Orb, however, offers continuous access to these donors to vote on further funding of projects (and, in turn, the future direction of Evmos) for as long as the user is a part of the DAO\n\n5. Who decides which projects get funded?\n\nThe Orb governance token holders. These tokens can be acquired by anyone contributing to public goods through The Orb.\n\n6. What about early contributors having a lion share of the voting power?\n\nWhile governance tokens are allocated based on contributions to public goods, the exact governance mechanism can be finalized and tweaked as the project progresses.\n\n7. Is The Orb chain specific?\n\nYes. Other than the idea and concept, all operational aspects including governance, project selection, vetting, and funding are all decided by the Evmos community. We hope to foster a culture of public goods that’s specific to Evmos, while learning lessons from other chains and improving the project as a whole for everyone!\n\n8. How will you ensure the safety of the treasury from being exploited & DAO from spam?\n\nThe treasury will be controlled by a multisig and all requests for funding will follow an application process governed by a project vetting council.\n\n9. How would The Orb work in conjunction with Liquid Staking?\n\nIt’s still too early to tell. Two possible solutions are:\n\nWe partner with the liquid staking service so that funds can directly be staked on The Orb\n\nWe re-wrap the synthetic asset and issue our own token\n\nReferences\n\na16z: The web3 landscape October 2021 [ https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-web3-Readlng-List.pdf ]\n\nGitcoin: Seeking a New Kind of Public Good: Open Call for Proposals [ https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/ ]\n\nTen Reasons Why People Don’t Donate to Charity [ https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/common-objections-to-giving/ ]\n\nA Guide To Public Goods for New Web3 Devs [ https://medium.com/ankr-network/a-guide-to-public-goods-for-new-web3-devs-59befc40ae77 ]\n\nFunding Public Goods in web3 for the Uninitiated [ https://jessykate.medium.com/funding-public-goods-in-web3-for-the-uninitiated-27493693c25c ]\n\nRecent discussions\n\nInteroperable Smart Contacts on Cosmos – Jacob Gadikian of Notional Labs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkdKfPVjTss (From 09:00 onward)\n\nMEV in the interchain – Sean Braithwaite of Mekatek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RW8i2vUeuo&t=3232s (From minute 53:52 onward)","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-10-25T16:23:01.467Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1wysd8jm57wnrycnd3tqqyzx5wmwx72gwmtd924\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Sheran\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"@sheran_sc\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-25T16:19:40.991Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstract\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nA wide variety of web3 public goods (such as tools, plugins and educational content) provide necessary infrastructure essential to the growth of blockchain ecosystems.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nMost web3 public goods and open-source software rely on donations to fund their work.

Furthermore, one-off donations are fleeting as they lack to establish a relationship between the donor and the cause.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/flarcos/ )\n\nHabeeb Bombata (twitter) ( https://linkedin.com/in/nottherealillest )\n\nEmail :\n\ninfo@footieszn.com\n\nFunding requested (in USD)\n\n$50,000 (Updated 28th of Oct 2022)\n\nTeam Information:\n\nHabeeb Bombata - Operations & Product - previously at Float YCW21, Paxful, Cloudbees, Bento.\n\nGbolahan Onadeko - Product & Engineering - 8+ years blockchain veteran.\n\nDan Mgbor (BENQI co-founder) - Angel investor and Advisor\n\nJesse Ghansah( Float and OMG digital ) - Angel investor and Advisor\n\nThe team behind FootieSZN has been building blockchain-based applications for over 3 years, A few of the Projects the team has previously worked on include :\n\nDappy network : A stablecoin to fiat offramp platform that allows users receive payments across 80+ countries worldwide.\n\nUniversalAPI : A payment clearing platform that allows businesses to send and receive funds.\n\nWhat is FootieSZN:\n\nFootieSzn is a fantasy football game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real-life football players and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. We are currently operating out of the British virgin islands with aspirations to extend operations around the world.\n\nIt is estimated that the 2022 world cup finals in Qatar will be watched by over 5 billion people. At least 8 out of 10 people support one form of sport and are very knowledgeable about it, Football/Soccer fans are estimated to be around 3.5 billion people.\n\nWith almost no learning curve for fans, we are developing a fantasy sports service that enables individuals to participate, earn, and enjoy what they are already fans of.\n\nThe Total number of blockchain users is estimated at around 80m WorldWide, FootieSZN can build a fantasy football gaming experience to tap into such a huge fan base which will be a huge win for the blockchain economy, especially Evmos, Also FootieSZN is not just stopping at Football/Soccer, We plan to expand and create an SZNVerse where we build fantasy for each sport (Cricket, NBA, NFL, Ruby, Baseball, etc).\n\nFootieSZN has been in development for a little over a year, A lot of which has been mostly researching and engineering phases, and in that time we have built out an MVP which we launched on a Testnet in August 2022 with 4,000+ Participants currently. We have been running on a very lean budget, mostly bootstrapped with some help from some Angel Investors.\n\nWe are yet to raise our Pre-Seed/Seed round.\n\nWe are asking the Evmos Community with this proposal to help fund our development to take it to the next level.\n\nWhat is the place of the SZN token?\n\nWe are building toward an SZN Verse that would consist of various fantasy sports.\n\n(Football/Soccer, Basketball, Cricket, Ruby, etc) With each Sport having a large fan base, we are creating a medium of value that would be used in SZN Verse,\n\nSZN is the medium of exchange in SZN Verse.\n\nHow will it gain & maintain the value?\n\nFootieSZN operates a freemium model however Users would be required to use SZN tokens to enhance their experience with different game modes.\n\nBuying function performing NFT like Booster Packs (Triple Captain, Clean Sheet, etc)\n\nBuying cosmetic type NFTs like Managers, Badges, themes, etc\n\nCreating private leagues and pools.\n\nCreating sponsored leagues.\n\nScouts Reports.\n\nPlease note that the above is currently for just Football/Soccer, as we expand into other sports the list of utilities will increase.\n\nOnboarding Users:\n\nOnboarding web2 users is a priority for FootieSZN, We plan to build out an Android & IOS App that will make it easy for regular users to onboard and use FootieSZN easily, Existing Web3 users will also be onboarded but our focus will be on web2 users, by building engineering infrastructure or leveraging existing technologies like Ramper/Arcana to abstract complex details like wallet addresses, etc\n\nUsers will be able to sign up with just their email addresses and no prior crypto gaming experience.\n\nWhy FootieSZN over another fantasy protocol?\n\nFootieSZN intends to stay true to being a traditional fantasy sport protocol, unlike existing Fantasy protocols/ Platforms that require participants to sink a lot of funds to be able to be competitive.\n\nEg: A new user onboarding on SORARE will need an average of $1420 to be averagely competitive in its league system, In FootieSZN player NFTs are free and this removes the onboarding barriers and allow people to enjoy and play the game they love and support while they enhance their experience within their finance.\n\nWhat will this app look like when it’s first ready?\n\nFootieSZN will launch first with Soccer/Football right before the start of the 2023/2024 season then we estimate releasing at least one more sport before the end of 2023.\n\nOur setup which we built Soccer on, allows us to integrate other sports faster, we would estimate around a 6-month development period to launch.\n\nWe will always try to launch a new sport before the season starts.\n\nGame modes in FootieSZN?\n\nThe game mode in the football FootieSZN:\n\nGeneral League: This league is a public league owned by the platform in which everyone can participate.\n\n1V1: Participants on FootieSZN can challenge each other to a single matchday contest where the participant with the highest points wins the pool prize created between the two users.\n\nWorldcup: build your team based on the countries and players participating in the World Cup and contest against other teams.\n\nStoryMode: (Stealth)\n\nGo-to-market strategy / Customer acquisition.\n\nWe believe our strongest customer acquisition path will be the community.\n\nWe're going to focus on growing and engaging a community of fantasy sports fans by\n\nLeveraging and partnering with existing Reddit / discord gaming communities\n\nPartnering with local sport fan bases across multiple teams/stadiums\n\nLeveraging local Facebook and telegram communities\n\nWeekly content, videos, blogs, and engagement on social media\n\nIn-app referral system\n\nPartnering with sports influencers and journalists that already have cult-like followers and community\n\nSponsoring local community sporting events\n\nWeekly twitter spaces, town halls, and more to keep the community engaged.\n\nWhat are the expected costs for the audits, smart contracts, and other features?\n\nWe are actively building and will require more funds as we progress.\n\nWe are estimating costs for product development around $200k, there are also marketing costs and more.\n\nThe estimate for just one of our smart contracts is about $8500 (we have multiple smart contracts)\n\nWill the Evmos community cover all of this?\n\nWe do not expect Evmos to cover all the development costs as we will raise them with VCs as well.\n\nThis initial funding will get us to a place where we can build a fantastic MVP that will change\n\nthe crypto gaming space.\n\nWill you only be fantasy & final outcome prediction, or will you ever move to a full-on Bovata-style betting platform?\n\nBased on the vision we have, we want to build a game people will love and play.\n\nFootieSZN will only be a fantasy, final outcome prediction, and simulation

It is a game whose outcome is strongly influenced by some randomizing device.\n\nExample of Game of Skill:\n\ncollectible card games\n\ncontract bridge\n\nBackgammon\n\nMahjong.\n\nExample of Game of chance:\n\nPoker,\n\npoker dice\n\nCraps,\n\nRoulette\n\nGame of chance falls under gambling and any platform engaging will require a gambling license.\n\nFootieSZN does not fall under the game of chance and does not need a gambling license.\n\nLinks:\n\n The legality of fantasy sport\n\nSkill vs Chance in fantasy sport\n\nImage right\n\nThe word “commercial” is key because in the present model, a fantasy sport does not use the image and name of the sportsperson for any direct revenue. The image is merely used to identify the player and, unless otherwise agreed upon, not used for any endorsement or promotional purposes. This model drastically changes in case of NFTs. Trading of Sorare collectible’s is akin to real world trading of football cards, with the collectible depicting the name, image and relevant stats of the sportsperson. In such a scenario, obtaining a license for any third-party copyright of the sportsperson’s image may be required. This license can then be granted to users in a more limited capacity.\n\nFootieSZN only uses Images for identification and statistical purposes only, We do not sell the Player NFT, Participants can collect/mint as many players as they want for free.\n\nExtracts:\n\nUnderstanding the Legal Landscape of Fantasy Sports and NFT Gaming\n\n(Updated Oct 28th, 2022)","kind":"discussion","stage":"Rejected","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-10-21T10:50:58.938Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1l6nps6lwl5vpnhmhcujfgzn0npysth2yars466\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Flarcos | FootieSZN\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Co-Founder  Footieszn.com\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-20T14:39:51.609Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Project name\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"FootieSZN\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Date of submission\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"20th of Oct 2022\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Name of company\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"FOOTIE SZN LABS LIMITED (BVI)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Contact information\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nGbolahan Onadeko\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://twitter.com/gbflarcos\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"(twitter\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\") (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/flarcos/\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/flarcos/\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\")\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nHabeeb Bombata \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://twitter.com/SeniorBombata\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"(twitter)\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\" (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://linkedin.com/in/nottherealillest\\\",\\\"underline\\\":true,\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"https://linkedin.com/in/nottherealillest\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\")\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Email : \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\ninfo@footieszn.com\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Funding requested (in USD)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n$200,000\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Team Information:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Habeeb Bombata - Operations & Product - previously at Float YCW21, Paxful, Cloudbees, Bento.\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Gbolahan Onadeko - Product & Engineering -

We are currently operating out of the British virgin islands with aspirations to extend operations around the world.\\\\n\\\\nIt is estimated that the 2022 world cup finals in Qatar will be watched by over 5 billion people. At least 8 out of 10 people support one form of sport and are very knowledgeable about it, Football/Soccer fans are estimated to be around 3.5 billion people.\\\\n\\\\nWith almost no learning curve for fans, we are developing a fantasy sports service that enables individuals to participate, earn, and enjoy what they are already fans of.\\\\nThe Total number of blockchain users is estimated at around 80m WorldWide, FootieSZN can build a fantasy football gaming experience to tap into such a huge fan base which will be a huge win for the blockchain economy, especially Evmos, Also FootieSZN is not just stopping at Football/Soccer, We plan to expand and create an SZNVerse where we build fantasy for each sport (Cricket, NBA, NFL, Ruby, Baseball, etc).\\\\n\\\\nFootieSZN has been in development for a little over a year, A lot of which has been mostly researching and engineering phases, and in that time we have built out an MVP which we launched on a Testnet in August 2022 with 4,000+ Participants currently. We have been running on a very lean budget, mostly bootstrapped with some help from some Angel Investors.\\\\nWe are yet to raise our Pre-Seed/Seed round.\\\\nWe are asking the Evmos Community with this proposal to help fund our development to take it to the next level.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"What is the place of the SZN

easily, Existing Web3 users will also be onboarded but our focus will be on web2 users, by building engineering infrastructure or leveraging existing technologies like Ramper/Arcana to abstract complex details like wallet addresses, etc\\\\nUsers will be able to sign up with just their email addresses and no prior crypto gaming

competitive in its league system, In FootieSZN player NFTs are free and this removes the onboarding barriers and allow people to enjoy and play the game they love and support while they enhance their experience within their finance.\\\\n\\\\nWhat will this app look like when it’s first ready? \\\\nFootieSZN will launch first with Soccer/Football right before the start of the 2023/2024 season then we estimate releasing at least one more sport before the end of 2023.\\\\nOur setup which we built Soccer on, allows us to integrate other sports faster, we would estimate around a 6-month development

Evmos Community,\n\nWho Are We:\n\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs ( http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:\n\nETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n\nDeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n\nETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n\nETH Seattle (July 2023)\n\nETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\nWe are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.\n\nWe expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\n\nTo us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nIn the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\n\nOther sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\nWHY THE CONFERENCES WERE VALUABLE TO EVMOS\n\nBeyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.\n\nWe’re Part Of The Ecosystem:\n\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF & DeFi Bogota.

However, if there's interest in recording Evmos talks at our events, we can include an optional recording package for $30k (= $6k per event across 5 events). With this package, the entire conference will be recorded and we'll post the recordings on youtube for viewers to watch. To thank the Evmos community for their support, for ALL the videos, we'll link to the Evmos site in \"Descriptions\" to help drive traffic. If there's interest in this option, please vote accordingly on the poll.\n\nWe're open to the community's feedback on our event series!","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-10-18T00:58:21.800Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos19234wkqdcycjzyvp2y327l75ey0elw3z7m0sx2\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Hsin-Ju w/ Dystopia Labs\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-18T00:34:40.048Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Dear Evmos Community,\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Who Are We:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"http://dystopialabs.com).\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"http://dystopialabs.com).\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota.

We had an overall budget of $125k for DeFi Bogota. The venue and catering made up the bulk of the costs. We also worked w/ vendors for AV and furniture setup. We have not sold any of the EVMOS that we received yet.\n\nThankfully, beyond EVMOS, we also received sponsorship from: UMA, Blocknative, 1inch, Figment, Raid Guild, Mask Network, Ellipti, Harmony, Stacks, Rarible, Protocol Labs, Mina, DODOex, and Coinbase.\n\nOur Plans Moving Forward:\n\nWe plan to put on 5 IRL conferences in 2023.

Community Pool Spend: Recover IBC tokens from Airdrop\n​\n## Author\n​\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n​\n## Motivation\n​\nEvmos’ [Rektdrop](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) pioneered a new model for distributing tokens. As announced on the [Evmos dashboard](https://app.evmos.org/mission-control), the Rektdrop ended on Block [5074187](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/5074187) (30 September 2022 at 16:06:40 UTC) and clawed back of all unclaimed tokens, returning them to the Evmos Community Pool.\n\nDuring this process, the [IBC module account](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x) was falsely targeted for clawback and transferred all EVMOS tokens from the IBC module account to the Evmos Community Pool. At the time of the clawback, this account held a balance of ~3.2 million EVMOS tokens (3167501226339726493675414aevmos). \n\nTo remediate this unexpected transfer of funds, we propose to return the funds from the Evmos Community Pool back to the IBC module account with this proposal. Note that we are simply withdrawing the amount from the Community Pool that could affect users and not the entire amount in the Community Pool.\n​\n## Impact\n​\nThe EVMOS tokens on the IBC module account represent the total amount of EVMOS tokens that have been sent to other chains over IBC. Users may currently be encountering an inability to transfer their EVMOS balances on these other chains back to Evmos. This is because there is an insufficient balance on the IBC module account. The Community Pool Spend outlined in this proposal would restore the balance on the IBC module account, enabling users to once again transfer up to their entire balance of EVMOS tokens from other Comsmos chains back to the Evmos chain via IBC.\n\nThe bug also falsely targeted some additional user accounts during the clawback. This means that some users' funds were accidentally clawed back to the Community Pool as well. We’ve moved quickly to identify the wallets affected and amounts that each are owed. We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \n\n## Requested amount\n\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\n\nBefore clawback:\n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\nbalances:\n- amount: \"3167501226339726493675414\"\n  denom: aevmos\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nAfter clawback: \n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\nbalances:\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nThe entire EVMOS balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \n\n## Learnings\n\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \\n​\\n## Requested amount\\n​\\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\\n​\\nBefore clawback:\\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"3167501226339726493675414\\\"\\n  denom: aevmos\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nAfer clawback: \\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nThe entire Emvos balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \\n​\\n## Learnings\\n​\\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Authors:** \n\n- LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend. With a participation rate of almost 90%, the Governance Workstream will most likely be fighting to maintain the status quo, as we are almost at the ceiling.\n\n| Rank | Network  | Voter Turnout | Sample Data (20 Props) | Data |\n| ---- | -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |-------------|\n| 1    | Evmos    | 87.35%        | Proposals 44 - 64                 | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1701165887)  |\n| 2    | Juno     | 82.88%        | Proposals 14 - 39                   | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=248293121)  |\n| 3    | Osmosis  | 64.74%        | Proposals 319 - 340                | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=1919390603)   |\n| 4    | Stargaze | 61.85%        | Proposals 30 - 53                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=508354030) |\n| 5    | Cosmos   | 47.49%        | Proposals 56 - 77                    | [Source 🔗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gOeVy87__DMSnd-qMkrD2zt4sLU_hNGU1B7KsTf25bo/edit#gid=206262929) |\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7I6nd2O.png)\n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nIn addition to all the proposals that have gone on-chain, the Evmos Community has seen a tremendous, sustained growth in off-chain governance participation, specifically on Commonwealth.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/413Pd2P.png)\n\n---\n\n### Workstream Members and Organizational Structure\n\n**Workstream Structure**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will function as a two-level hierarchy, consisting of \n - This difference in accountability means that decision-making power must lie in the hands of the stewards rather than the contributors, and is the reason for this explicit hierarchy.\n - Workstream leaders in their second term are automatically elected to a Governance Council Director role.\n - In practice, it is expected that Council Contributors and Council Directors operate and communicate as equals.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that presents a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a much comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentives programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upwards trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 250,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 375,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the pre-cursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosytem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a ~30K EVMOS grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **500,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 300K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 267,614 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 500,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 700,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,792,614 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles.

Standardized Compensation Framework\n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members.\n\nThis framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders & the DAO, reducing the power imbalance/privilege that certain parties may have.\n\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. **Value Level** - refers to the contributor’s expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributor's level.\n\n| Value Level Assessment |   Summary | 1 | 2 | 3 | \n| --------      | -------- | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n| Knowledge Requirement & Difficulty     | The amount of domain-specific knowledge required to successfully execute one's duties. |  Basic working knowledge. Obtainable through a couple weeks of onboarding and training.  | Domain-specific knowledge. Obtainable through years of study or training in a specific domain. | Niche or advanced knowledge. Subject matter expertise that is only obtainable through years of deep commitment and experience in a niche field. |\n| Replaceability & Talent Pool Size  | The difficulty of finding or replacing talent for the duties required by the role.  | Roles can be filled with relative ease. Large pool of potential workers due to low barrier of entry. | Thorough vetting required, can take months to fill. Contributor should have experience in the domain and will be expected to excel in assigned duties. | Difficult to replace, domain-expertise in addition to deep organizational-specific knowledge required (i.e. knowledge in the DAO's governance processes, financial and revenue structures, ongoing projects, etc.)  |\n| Contribution Importance | The level of importance of the duties held by a contributor for the long-term success of the DAO as well as the Evmos network. | Little to no effect on the Evmos ecosystem. Such roles are likely to be in experimental workstreams or external-facing projects. | Important to the long-term growth of the Evmos ecosystem. | Crucial importance - contributions will have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and the Evmos ecosystem. |\n| Value Level      | Calculated by simply taking the average of the three aforementioned  assessments.  | -------- |-------- |-------- |\n\n2. **Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders. \n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: \n\n- Full-time commitment and 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 100%\n- Full-time commitment with 20% of focus/prioritization of a secondary DAO -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 32 hours / week with 100% prioritization of workstream duties -> 80%\n- Part-time commitment of 20 hours / week -> 50%\n\nThe self-assessment of Commitment Levels is very untraditional in the sense of \"normal companies\" - this is intentional, as the DAO space has repeatedly shown the value in cross-chain / cross-DAO collaborations and networking. \n\nContributions to other projects and DAOs are encouraged! *(Just remember to make a note of it and adjust your Commitment Level accordingly)*\n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**\n\n`Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n\n---\n\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n1. Contribution Level - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members. \n\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle: \n\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\n- etc.\n\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\n\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\n\n\n\n| Accountablility | For | - |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 1     | Self       | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties.     |\n| 1.5     | Workstream / subDAO       | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream.  |\n| 2     | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3.     |\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\n\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\n- Vesting amount is calculated in USD and adjusted to the price of EVMOS every funding cycles.\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as EVMOS to contributors.\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO. \n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-10T18:08:15.675Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-09T17:37:12.548Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Standardized Compensation Framework\\n\\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy.

For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members. \\n\\nContribution Level Awarded per Funding Cycle: \\n\\n- 100% Commitment: 0.5 pts\\n- 80% Commitment: 0.4 pts\\n- 50% Commitment: 0.25 pts\\n- etc.\\n\\nContribution Level points are capped at a maximum of 4 points. The accrual of 4 points would mean that the contributor achieved 100% satisfactory full-time commitment for 4 years.\\n\\n2. Accountability Level - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n| Accountablility | For | - |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\\n| 1     | Self       | All members are accountable for their own satisfactory execution and fulfillment of assigned duties.     |\\n| 1.5     | Workstream / subDAO       | Workstream leaders are accountable for the continued success and advancement of the workstreams' respective mandates, as well as the effective mangement of the contributing members in the workstream.  |\\n| 2     | DAO Treasury & Advancements | Members that are signatories of the DAO treasury and responsible for the advancement of the initiatives laid out in ECP-3.     |\\n\\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**\\n\\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\\n\\n- Vesting schedule for all contracts are 4-years.\\n- Vested tokens will be streamed from the contract as WEVMOS to contributors.\\n- As everyone's Contribution Level starts at 0 points, this effectively acts as the 6-month cliff as previously proposed.\\n- The vesting contracts for all workstreams and contributors will be adjusted accordingly each funding cycle, or every 6 months.\\n- The vesting compensation is in place for various reasons, but the focal point is the retainment of talent -- thus, contracts will be revoked for contributors that are no longer serving the DAO. \\n- Token vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contracts through governance proposals - this ensures that the Council members are subject to the same terms.\\n\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-11-10T18:08:15.704Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T16:58:42.568Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-14T15:33:07.515Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-12T21:35:14.858Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-11-17T18:44:56.530Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\n\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \n\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \n\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\n\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \n - Community-governed incentives program\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\n\n\n## Motivation \n\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \n\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\n\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \n\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\n\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \n\n\n---\n\n\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\n\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \n\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\n\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\n\n\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\n\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\n\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \n\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \n\n---\n\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\n\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \n\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\n\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \n\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\n\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \n\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\n\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \n\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\n\n\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\n\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community. We hope that our previous efforts are recognized by the Community and is a testament to our genuine dedication to the advancement of the Evmos ecosystem and network. \n\nThe target operational, development, and incentives runway with this funding request is **one year**; however, we hope to extend that runway as much as possible through various programs. On the other hand, the absolute best case scenario for the DAO would be to achieve self-sustainability by late next year. \n\n| # | Initiative | Description | Allocation  | \n| - | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 1 | Workstream (SubDAO) Funding | Compensation of current and future workstream members and the funding of workstream initiatives. | 20%     |\n| 2 | GOV Tokenomics & Community Gauges | The $GOV token and the gauge system is designed to decentralize Liquidity Incentives allocation, promote long-term alignments, and facilitate off-chain governance voting. | 12.5%     |\n| 3 | Boosted Liquidity Vaults & veGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that are community-led, more transparent, DEX-agnostic, and shared benefits. | 22.5%     |\n| 4 | Perpetual Bounty Fund & deGOV | The funding of the new proposed liquidity incentives programs that is community-led, more transparent, and is DEX-agnostic. | 10%     | \n| 5 | Treasury Growth & yGOV | Initial funding for DeFi revenue generation strategies and yield-bearing GOV tokens | 7.5%     |\n| 6 | Treasury Bonds | Building community-owned liquidity through the sales of treasury issued bonds. | 5%     |\n| 7 | Strategic Reserves | The reserves will be used only when strategic opportunities are presented to the DAO or rebalancing of the treasury is necessary.

A combination of tried and true strategies as well as novel implementations in DeFi and smart contracting will be utilized. Heavy inspiration is drawn from well-established and successful DAOs that have pioneered the way in governance philosophies and decentralized finance and economics: MakerDAO, Compound, Curve, Yearn, Gnosis, 1Hive, Uniswap, Sushi, Aave, ShapeShift, Balancer, MolochDAO, and many more.\n\n### GOV: Evmos DAO Governance Base Token Layer\n\nAlignment between the Evmos DAO governance token (GOVMOS, or GOV for short) holders and protocol stakeholders (EVMOS) is crucial for an *efficient* decentralized governance -- GOV tokens are the vehicle to drive this alignment. GOV tokens are not a financial investment, although there will be economic benefits. GOV token holders are typically DAO contributors and Evmos Community members who are committed to seeing the continued growth of the Evmos ecosystem, and want a seat at the governance table.\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work — reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and voting on every matter can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain.\n\nThis approach is not to be a gatekeeper of decisions - anyone who wishes will be able to participate. The key difference between on-chain proposals and off-chain DAO proposals is that DAO governance is *voluntary*. \n\n$GOV will be launched as an ERC20 with a 1:1 EVMOS backing. In simpler terms, depositing one EVMOS token will mint you one GOV token; reciprocally, returning one GOV token will release one EVMOS token. GOV tokens are transferrable, fungible, and tradeable. GOV serves as the base layer token for the many functions of its derivatives. **Holding GOV tokens do not grant any voting power.**\n\n**Important concept to remember:** `$GOVMOS` is essentially `$WEVMOS` but with expanded feature sets that allow the DAO and community participants to create and govern the following derivatives and programs. \n\n### GOV Derivatives Overview\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WN7f8LC.png)\n\n\n### veGOV: Aligned & Incentivized Decentralized Decision Making\n\nParticipating in Evmos DAO governance requires that a wallet have a balance of vote-escrowed GOV (veGOV). veGOV is a non-standard ERC20 implementation, popularized and battle-tested by DAOs on Ethereum, that determines each wallet's voting power.\n\nveGOV is obtained by depositing and locking GOV into the DAO's escrow contract. The maximum lock time is two years, and the minimum one month. \n\nThe amount of veGOV received is proportional to the lock-time selected - locking 100 GOV for the maximum two year period will return 100 veGOV. A one year lock of 100 GOV would return 50 veGOV, and so forth. \n\nOnce veGOV is issued to a wallet the tokens will automatically begin decaying at a 1/2 slope linear rate until the time-lock period is reached. For example, if 500 veGOV tokens were rewarded at the time of deposit, 250 veGOV would remain at the time when the vesting period is complete and the original GOV tokens are available for withdrawal. \n\nUsers may decide to keep the original GOV tokens vested even after the completion date in order to retain the remaining veGOV. However, as soon as the original GOV tokens are claimed back into the originating wallet, the remaining veGOV will burn itself.\n\nThe vote-escrowed approach plays several crucial roles in the DAO's governance and our long term goals:\n\n1) Significantly reduces Sybil and other attack vectors in off-chain governance proposals\n2) Ensures that participants are aligned with the long-term goals of the DAO and our vision\n3) Incentivizes governance participation with boosted yields\n4) Will be the main driver of the Liquidity Incentives Program 2.0 with community-governed incentives allocation and DEX-agnostic TVL growth\n5) Generates recurring revenue and treasury diversification through DAO-owned liquidity\n\n**Liquidity Gauges**: A pre-determined amount of EVMOS tokens will be allocated towards Liquidity Incentives each month. veGOV weight from community participants will ultimately dictate the allocation of incentives for each liquidity pool. \n\nThrough the gauge system we are able to run our liquidity incentives program perpetually and in a much more decentralized, fair, and community-centric method. \n\n**Multi-Token Liquidity Mining**: Each pool's Gauge contract can distribute up to 5 different kinds of tokens. This allows for multiple partners/protocols/DAOs to incentivize a given pool by adding their own tokens. \n\nThe goal of the Liquidity Guages is to be as permissionless and community-governed as possible. However, the Governance Council may blacklist tokens from being able to be deposited as an incentivization token to combat spam.\n\n**Liquidity Vaults (Lockers)**: DAO-owned liquidity vaults (farms) will be deployed to maintain our stance of neutrality and allow the natural growth and healthy competition between DEXs and DeFi protocols. \n\nIn an effort to facilitate the steady growth of Evmos' TVL and liquidity, incentives will be boosted for those who commit to a bonding period when depositing their LP tokens. Auto-compounding contracts will also be deployed and utilized to maximize the yield for depositors.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KcoDXpG.png)\n\n**Current Problem**: While Prop 64 provided the Evmos network the much needed native liquidity, the proposal was not designed to be a long-term solution. The TVL that has been built is held hostage by the high farming APRs provided at the expense of the Community Pool. The lack of any lockup mechanism also encourages \"pool hopping\" leading to potentially volatile liquidity and subsequently volatile price movements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4ScBYt4.png)\n\n \n### deGOV: Governance Rewards for Network Decentralization Assistance\n\nDelegated GOV tokens, or deGOV are similar to veGOV in that they hold voting weight. However, while veGOV is deflationary once received, deGOV gains voting weight the longer they are staked with the DAO. deGOV tokens are minted at a 1:2 ratio, meaning a 10 GOV deposit will return 5 deGOV.\n\ndeGOV does not have a maximum time-lock period, but will stop accruing voting power at 24 months, with a voting weight boost of 2x of the original deposit. The minimum bonding time is one month,\n\n**The Perpetual Bounty Fund**\n\ndeGOV will play a key role in the maintaining the sustainability of the Community Perpetual Bounty Fund. The concept of the Perpetual Bounty Fund straightforward - the DAO participates in network staking for the purpose of creating a self-replenishing fund for bounties, contributor payments, and special initiatives. \n\n- The authz module is utilized to re-stake “maintenance” token amounts to offset the daily changing APR.\n- A portion of the daily rewards (TBD) are sent to a claiming contract in which deGOV holders may wish to claim their share of the staking rewards.\n- The remainder of the rewards are claimed and sent back into a DAO treasury wallet used for bounties and funding initiatives. \n- If the bounty fund's growth is far exceeding the pace of outbound funds, the DAO may choose to re-route the funds to another program or into the Strategic Reserve fund.\n\nBounties can range from internal growth initiatives to external outreach campaigns. An internal growth example would be to bounty out a SourceCred deployment on Evmos to incentivize participation in governance, encourage constructive discussions, nurture a culture of helping others, etc. The potential bounties and programs can also act as an assistance tool for the core devs by contributing in areas like the improvement and expansion of the Evmos documentation. \n\nAs we eagerly wait for our community to grow and have leaders step up in the creation of new workstreams, bounties are an excellent tool to not only lighten the already heavy workload, but to attract talent, long-term contributors, and future leaders.\n\n**Delegation Gauges**: Similar to Liquidity Gauges, the community will have the power to decide the allocation amounts for 75% of the delegateable tokens from the Perpetual Bounty Fund. The Governance Council, although unlikely to happen often, reserves the right to decide the monthly delegation amounts of the remaining 25%.\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is restricted from delegating to any validator in the top 25 by VP, calculated at the last day of each month. Any votes towards the top 25 validators will be disregarded and allocations distributed proportionately to the eligible validators.  \n\n### yGOV: Yield Bearing Single-Sided Staking Rebase Tokens\n\nYield bearing GOV (or yGOV) are obtained by depositing GOV into an escrow contract controlled by the DAO. **yGOV does not have any voting weight.**\n\nyGOV is a rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with GOV. EVMOS tokens that are represented by the deposited GOV will be deployed into the network's DeFi ecosystem to generate optimized yields. The rebasing occurs shortly after every Evmos epoch and the yields are transferred directly to the users. This allows the constant accural of yields without the need for any action from the end user. \n\nThe redemption (unbonding) time for yGOV is 15 days. Instant withdrawals may be possible depending on the reserve liquidity available at that the time, but will incur a harsh 25% penalty fee. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R48AOko.png)\n\n\n**Liquidity Reserve**: A small reserve liquidity for the yGOV<>GOV swap contract will be maintained for those who are in an emergency and willing to incur the penalty fee.\n\n**yvGOV (Yield-Bearing Vested GOV)** is another GOV deriviative that is being researched. yvGOV will be a vested version of yGOV, with similar characteristics of veGOV. \n\n## Treasury Bonds Market\n\nProtocol owned liquidity (POL) is an important topic that is constantly brought up as one of the most important aspects of growing a healthy treasury. While POL is mostly used in the context of DeFi protocols' and product/service DAOs' treasuries, Evmos DAO is unique in that we are serving a community of an entire Layer-1 Blockchain. Thus, we feel justified in using the term \"Community Owned Liquidity.\" Just as we defend the integrity of the Evmos Constitution and our Governance System, we must fight to defend the value of our network. \n\n**Benefits of Community Owned Liquidity**\n\n- Diversification of Assets\n- Revenue Generation from Swap Fees\n- Long-term Aligned Ecosystem Growth\n- Stable Network-Wide Liquidity\n\n[WIP]\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Ideation","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:32:35.427Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury\\n\\n## ⚠ Work in Progress - Live & Changing Document\\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council \\n\\n**Summary**: The funding of this proposal (Phase 2) will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. \\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting Xmil EVMOS (\\\\~N% of the Community Pool) to initiate the DAO’s Treasury with the goal of being a self-sustainable, self-funded DAO within the next year.\\n\\n - Quick and effective deployment of incentive programs and project/partner onboarding initiatives\\n - Alignment of incentives and off-chain governance \\n - Community-governed incentives program\\n - Utilization of both novel and tried-and-true strategies in an ongoing effort to make Evmos DAO a self-sustainable entity\\n\\n\\n## Motivation \\n\\nAs over 108mil tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.  \\n\\nOur long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\\n\\nFor example, Uniswap (est. 2018) is known for singlehandedly propelling the world of DeFi with their concept of liquidity pools. They boast the world’s largest treasury worth nearly $3bil, and yet growth and innovation was not meeting their expectations. Just a few months ago Uniswap governance passed a landmark proposal to create the “Uniswap Foundation” with a funding of $75mil. The foundation wanted  “to reduce governance friction at Uniswap for high-impact and high-value projects and improve navigation in the ecosystem.” \\n\\nThe realization that a strict, rigid governance can be a huge impediment for effective off-chain decision making and the execution of projects and initiatives is spreading through the Ethereum ecosystem like wildfire. In just the past three months, the following notable DAOs have formed their own versions of their foundation for the purpose of reducing friction in their ability to be effective: Rarible DAO, Pool Together DAO, TrueFi DAO, Synapse DAO, Developer DAO, Bancor DAO, Balancer DAO, and a handful more (it should be noted that the term “Foundation” in these aforementioned DAOs have a different connotation from the Evmos “Foundation”).\\n\\nThis is a phenomenon that Evmos DAO will closely be monitoring, as we strive to continuously improve and are always on the lookout for developments in more effective governance. However, this new trend gives us a boost of confidence that forming a DAO Treasury separate from the Community Pool is not only the right move, but a smart move. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## DAO Treasury Specifications\\n\\n**Prerequisites**: Accountability within a DAO is all about setting and holding contributors and governance participants to a common expectation aligned with the DAO’s mission, values, and goals. The same principles should apply to treasury management and spending processes. \\n\\nThe specifications of the Evmos DAO Treasury are designed with the following accountability measures in place:\\n\\n 1. Safe, upgradeable contracts managed by trusted multi-signatories\\n 2. Transparency and clarity on all spending via off-chain proposals with timelock\\n 3. The delegation of responsibilities to workstream leaders within the DAO\\n 4. Secondary contracts for risk management (vested token releases, payment streaming, payment splitting)\\n\\n\\n**Main Multisig Specifications:** The main treasury will be a Gnosis Safe deployment, the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its n-of-m configuration will start as 4-of-7 on Evmos mainnet. Both parameters n and m may evolve and are ultimately defined by DAO members and the Evmos Community with security in mind.\\n\\nSafe Audits: [(External Link)](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/docs)\\n\\nThe multisig will initially be composed of Governance Council Directors and trusted ecosystem members or validators (in the case that we are not able to fill all 7 slots). A shortlist of backup signers will be maintained in the case that a signatory must be removed or is no longer capable of fulfilling his or her duty.  \\n\\nSafe Deployment Address (Evmos Mainnet): `0x3E5c63644E683549055b9Be8653de26E0B4CD36E`\\nEvmos DAO Treasury Deployment:  `TBD` \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Flow of Funds (Simplified)**\\n\\nThe main treasury's main role is to enact and execute on-chain transfer of funds as decided by DAO participants via off-chain voting. It should be noted that the Governance Council will initially request funds for planned projects and will likely propose many more in the long term. \\n\\n![Example Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/SaUGC2q.png)\\n\\nThe eventual goal of the DAO treasury is to be fully community owned. This process of handing off the keys to the treasury can not happen, however, until the DAO's off-chain governance is well-matured and protected against potential bad actors. Progressive decentralization is a guiding value that we have pledged to in our Constitution, and we encourage the Community to keep us accountable. \\n\\n**Off-Chain Proposals**\\n\\nFor funding requests that are under the domain of the DAO's treasury, a GovernorAlpha contract — or a suitable alternative — will be deployed. \\n\\nThe proposal lifecycle of Governor contracts are relatively simple and offer the security of a mandatory timelock in which a malicious attempt can be veto'd.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z1ul6WS.png)\\n\\nFund distribution methods may differ from workstreams and special projects. For example, recipients may opt to utilize friendlier tools like Colony or Coordinape if they wish to do so. \\n\\nFor large funding requests or funding that is out of the scope of the DAO's programs, a formal on-chain proposal must be made to receive funding from the *Community Pool*.\\n\\n\\n## Road to Self-Sustainability & Decentralization Initiatives\\n\\nFor the past half-year, Evmos DAO contributors have been proudly serving the Community.

ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community is officially requesting formalization by funding. \n\n### **Workstream Introduction**\n\nDecentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \n\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\n\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\n\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\n\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \n\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\n\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\n\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \n\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\n\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\n\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\n\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\n\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\n\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\n\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\n\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\n\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \n\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\n\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\n\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\n\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\n\nAlthough we have begun the \"manual\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\n\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \n\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\n\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\n\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\n\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\n\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\`gov\\` module.\n\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\n\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\n\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\n\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \n\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\n - The Alignment of Incentives\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\n - (More in ECP-3)\n\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\n\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\n\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\n\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\n\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\n\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\n\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\n\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\n\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\n\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\n\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\n\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\n\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\n\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\n\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\n\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\n\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\n\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\n\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \n\n### Progress Report and Achievements\n\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\n\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\n\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\n\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\n\nAfter posting the [\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\n\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\n\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\n\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\n\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\n\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\n\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \n\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \n\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\n\n**R&D Fund Request**\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\n\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \n\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\n\n\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\n\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \n\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \n\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\n\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\n\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req.

It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.  \\n\\n**Mission**: Protect, improve, and serve the Evmos network and community with neutrality and transparency.\\n\\n**Vision**: To see Evmos DAO evolve into a fully decentralized and self-sustainable organization that is capable of propelling the growth of the network.\\n\\n**Values:** Progressive Decentralization, Continuous Improvement, Hybrid-Governance\\n\\n### Primary Duties (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Governance Framework Improvement & Implementation**\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework serves to empower each member of the community by providing clear and standardized methods of interacting with the wider DAO, thereby defining its future shape and trajectory. It is crucial that we strive to continuously improve our processes. \\n\\n - The Constitution must be completed and amended as committed in Proposal 51, which ratified the Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO.\\n - Governance proposals that have been passed by the community must be implemented and enforced, as long as they adhere to the Guiding Principles of our Constitution.\\n - We must be diligent in listening to the community's feedback on governance pain-points, shortcomings, and inefficiencies. \\n - We must strive to fix or improve inefficiencies and shortcomings when a viable plan is ideated or presented.\\n - We must continue our research and observations into other DAOs and remain up to date with evolving DAO philosophies, tools, and scientific research.\\n\\n**B. Continuous Efforts in Increasing Governance Participation & Engagement**\\n\\nThe strength of our governance relates directly to the participation levels in both on-chain and off-chain governance. Decisions and proposals can only be as well-rounded and well-defined as the number of participants that played a role in contributing to the ideation and feedback process. Similarly, a decision or proposal is only as credible as the consensus surrounding it. \\n\\n - The Governance Council has been aiming and will continue to promote and increase engagement by stakeholders in all aspects of the governance processes.\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and provide access to the resources necessary to participate in the governance process — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council should be in constant engagement with the community, in as many mediums as possible.\\n\\n**C. Facilitating Communications and the Flow of Information**\\n\\nEffective communication is a crucial strategy that must be used by the Governance Workstream. Transparent and effective governance requires an effective, reliable, and unbiased communications strategy. Without communication and information flow, it is extremely difficult to facilitate an effective and efficient governance.\\n\\n - The Governance Council will work to improve and create easier access to the resources necessary to understand and stay up-to-date in our governance — for all members of the community.\\n - The Governance Council must establish a more consistent, high-quality information feed of all issues and proposals for the community at large to digest.\\n - The Governance Council, when requested by the community, will act as a liaison to the Evmos Foundation and attempt to seek information and clarity into concerns or issues brought up. \\n - The Governance Council will remain in constant communication with the Foundation to ensure the alignment of the goals of the DAO, the community, and the core members. \\n - The Governance Council will work with the Community Moderation & Support team in the ideation of better communication initiatives, as well as pinpointing areas that are in need of improvements or clarifications.\\n - The Governance Council will host community meetings, project introductions, and public forums when requested.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to attend, participate in, and — if requested — take on the responsibility of hosting the weekly Governance meetings on Discord\\n\\n**D. Governance and Proposal Assistance and Feedback**\\n\\n - The Governance Workstream will continue to provide assistance to individuals, teams, and projects that are seeking to submit a proposal. This includes all phases, from pre-Commonwealth ideation to the final on-chain submission, assuming that all procedures are being followed properly and in good faith. Our assistance in drafting proposals should not be seen as an endorsement or guarantee.\\n - The Governance Workstream will always strive to voice all thoughts on an issue or proposal from a neutral, rational point of view.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to work on improving governance documentation and begin building tools and resources for a more effective, transparent, and user-friendly governance.\\n\\n**E.** **Onboarding of New Workstreams and sub-DAOs**\\n\\nThe Governance Council will assist in the creation of new workstreams. When focusing on accelerating the progress of the DAO, the goal is to grow horizontally via more sub-DAOs (vs. growing vertically). Through more sub-DAOs, the entire org can increase the number of teams trying new approaches to solving and innovating on existing problems and focuses while maintaining the same level of meta-organizational admin/overhead required to run. Our general stance on workstream or funding proposals will be:\\n\\n - Support funding proposals that present a decent chance of driving forward KPIs\\n - Explore funding proposals that may have a chance of bringing value and test the waters\\n - Support the allocation of more resources to sub-DAOs that are producing results and are looking to expand\\n - Investigate and potentially look into de-funding teams or initiatives that are not producing any results \\n\\n**F. Protocol & Cross-Chain Collaboration**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage with and act as a community liaison with protocols and projects seeking to build or collaborate with Evmos.\\n - The Governance Council will continue to engage in outreach to projects and protocols for potential collaborative initiatives that could be beneficial to the overall Evmos ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n**G. Evmos DAO’s Treasury Management, Diversification, & Growth**\\n\\n**Phase 1**\\n\\n - The Governance Council will deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig contract to be used as Evmos DAO’s Liquid Treasury.\\n - This contract will act as the DAO's liquid treasury for various purposes, including contributor and bounty rewards, liquidity and incentive programs, asset diversification, and minor expenses that do not warrant its own proposal.\\n - The Governance Council will make two treasury funding requests. The initial request will fund the development of the projects detailed in ECP-3.\\n\\n**Phase 2**\\n\\n- ECP-3 will be formally proposed when the projects detailed are close to completion, and receives the approval of the Evmos Community.\\n\\n### Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing & Planned)\\n\\n**A. Liquidity Incentives Programs 2.0** (In Progress)\\n\\nAlthough we have begun the \\\"manual\\\" Liquidity Incentives Program with our recent \\\"Kickstart Evmos DeFi\\\" proposal, our goal is to ultimately have this process determined by the community on a merit or milestone-based system.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this in a truly transparent and permissionless way, an Off-Chain Governance Framework is required. \\n\\n**(More info in ECP-3)**\\n\\n**B. Off-Chain Community Governance** (In Progress)\\n\\nOff-chain governance is often required for decisions in which the ultimate result is unknown and cannot be derived from on-chain data, thus requiring some human input. These decisions should be made with the mission, vision and goals of the DAO in mind.\\n\\n> DAOs work best when the governance burden related to curation, security, and risk can be reduced faster than the natural increase in coordination costs that accompanies the need to have members involved in voting on every decision made. - Tarun Chitra\\n\\nOptimizing for the right people to participate in governance processes is an ever-evolving discussion in governance circles today. It may not be pragmatic to assume that all voters should participate in every governance decision. Participating in governance is a lot of work—reading and digesting a proposal, providing feedback for discussion and going to vote can be mentally fatiguing. In addition, many do not have the subject matter expertise or desire to participate in proposals outside of their domain. \\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Evmos DAO and the Cosmos ecosystem,** in simplified terms, can be explained as governance decisions that do not need to commence a network-wide vote through the utilization of the Cosmos SDKs \\\\`gov\\\\` module.\\n\\nOff-Chain governance, **in the context of Decentralized Governance and DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem**, can be explained as all governance decisions that utilize decentralized data and DID protocols like Ceramic and IPFS to allow for gas-free voting, encouraging the participation of more token holders.\\n\\nDAO operations will likely be governed by contracts and tooling that are battle-tested and available on the EVM side of the chain. This opens up a new realm of possibilities for governance, trustless contracts, incentive alignment, and community collaboration.\\n\\nWhile this is a particularly complex and interesting topic, we do not want to dwell in contemplation more than needed nor do we want to be married to one idea or framework. Our off-chain governance styling, processes, and direction will likely evolve over time, as is common with all DAOs, new and old. (Reference: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall\\\\_(author)#Gall's_law))\\n\\nHigh-priority items needed for off-chain governance are currently under research and in experimentation phases in some cases; these include: \\n\\n - Different Voting Mechanisms\\n - The Alignment of Incentives\\n - Contracts, Protocols, and DAO Toolings\\n - Risk Reduction Efforts\\n - (More in ECP-3)\\n\\n**C. Perpetual Bounty Fund** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Perpetual Bounty Fund is a perpetual, self-replenishing bounty fund that is designed to minimize community spending while helping with network decentralization efforts.\\n\\nThe concept of a perpetual bounty fund is very straightforward and the establishment of the fund would only require a one-time spend request from the community pool.\\n\\n 1. The initial funds are delegated to a distributed set of validators that are in the mid-low ranking.\\n 2. The authz module from Cosmos SDK is utilized to re-stake a minimum “maintenance” amount (to account for decreasing APY rates)\\n 3. Utilizing authz, the remainder of the rewards are sent to a multisig wallet.\\n 4. The daily rewards are then utilized to fund bounty programs for the community.\\n\\nWhen compared to a normal community pool budget request, this model would A) take the initial funding amount out of the unbonded circulating supply; B) align with the community goals of striving towards more decentralization; C) provide a steady stream of a workable budget to be bountied out responsibly and methodically.\\n\\n**D. Governance Engagement Initiatives** (In Research)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is constantly looking into ideas or tools that may help with participation rate pre-voting on chain.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that the best way to reduce failed proposals is to address all community concerns during the early stages of a proposal. Increased participation in these early-stage proposals would greatly benefit Evmos governance, and is an initiative we are taking seriously.\\n\\nSome projects we are strongly considering in this area are a comprehensive governance dashboard, engagement tracking, and more.\\n\\n**E. Proposal Summary and Risk Assessment Reports** (Planned)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is looking to provide proposal summaries, context, and our risk assessments for all proposals that go on chain.\\n\\nTalks of potentially integrating these reports and other valuable metadata around a proposal into popular block explorers have been initiated and may be considered.\\n\\n**F. Deployment of Public Goods and Services** (In Progress)\\n\\nThe Governance Council is currently looking into public goods and infrastructure that we believe is needed to:\\n\\n - Attract more projects and organizations to migrate to Evmos\\n - Attract more developers to build on Evmos\\n - Allow more flexibility and functionality in what’s possible via governance\\n - Increase governance participation rate and the flow of information\\n\\nSome projects that the Governance Council has initiated in this domain:\\n\\n - [Governance Issue Tracker](https://evmos.community)\\n - [Evmos RPC Proxy](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-rpc-proxy)\\n - [Evmos Datahub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/evmos-datahub)\\n - [Webmos React Bootstrapping Kit](https://github.com/EvmosGov/webmos)\\n - Smart contracts for: token vesting, payment streaming, payment splits\\n - [Dashboard for Vesting Contracts](https://github.com/EvmosGov/contributor-vesting-ui)\\n\\n**G. Validator Fairness Initiative** (In Progress)\\n\\n - The VFI Group was created a few months back in an attempt to get consensus on a Code of Conduct for Validators.\\n - Although currently at a stalemate, there has been great discussions and is now over 100 members strong. \\n - We must reach a consensus, as the Interim Constitution was proposed on the premise that these difficult but pressing issues would not be forgotten.   \\n\\n### Progress Report and Achievements\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO has been operating informally with Governance Initiatives since early June 2022, and was formally recognized by the Evmos Community when the Constitution was ratified on August 31st, 2022. While we realize that we have much work ahead of us, we humbly celebrate the achievements the workstream and DAO members have made thus far.\\n\\n**Evmos Community Proposals**\\n\\nThe Governance Council and DAO Contributors have assisted in, provided support to, or played a direct role in the proposals listed below.\\n\\n| #   | Title                                                               | Role              |\\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\n| 27  | Evmos Get Momentum - $1m Evmos Developer Incentive Program Proposal | Feedback, Support |\\n| 31  | Grant Request to Sponsor EVMOS Public RPC by Pocket Network         | Feedback          |\\n| 34  | Extend Rektdrop Claims Period by 21 days                            | Direct            |\\n| 35  | Register ERC20 for Osmosis                                          | Direct            |\\n| 37  | Register ERC20 for ATOM (Cosmos Hub)                                | Direct            |\\n| 39  | Evmos external incentives on Osmosis                                | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 40  | Evmos Developer Acquisition with Dystopia Labs                      | Feedback, Support |\\n| 42  | Evmos Sponsorship of HackAtom Seoul 2022 / Korea Blockchain Week    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 44  | Parameter change (maximum deposit time, minimum deposit amount.)    | Direct            |\\n| 45  | Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos    | Multisig          |\\n| 48  | Register ERC20 for Stargaze (STARS)                                 | Direct            |\\n| 49  | Register ERC20 for Regen Network (REGEN)                            | Direct            |\\n| 51  | The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO                               | Direct            |\\n| 53  | Register ERC20 for Juno                                             | Direct            |\\n| 54  | Covalent API's Integration and the #OneMillionWallets Hackathon     | Support, Multisig |\\n| 56  | Register ERC20 for EEUR (e-Money Euro)                              | Direct            |\\n| 57  | Incubation: ChainHub Texas Blockchain Projects for Evmos            | Support, Feedback |\\n| 58  | Register ERC20 for axlUSDC (Axelar USDC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 60  | Register ERC20 for axlWBTC (Axelar wBTC)                            | Direct            |\\n| 61  | Register ERC20 for axlWETH (Axelar wETH)                            | Direct            |\\n| 62  | Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development                     | Multisig          |\\n| 64  | Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program                    | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 65  | Register ERC20 for stATOM (Stride Staked Atom)                      | Direct            |\\n| 67  | Liquidity Mining for Axelar, Celer, and Gravity on Kinesis          | Support, Multisig |\\n| 68  | Register ERC20 for USK (Stablecoin of Kujira)                       | Direct            |\\n| 70  | Extending Osmosis External Incentives                               | Direct, Multisig  |\\n| 71  | Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff                                       | Direct, Multisig  |\\n\\nAfter posting the [\\\"Passing a Community Proposal, Best Practices\\\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) guide, the Governance Workstream and DAO contributors assisted in passing **24 out of 25 proposals for a success rate of 96%.**\\n\\nWe are currently assisting in the facilitation and/or drafting of various additional proposals ranging from protocol onboarding to incentive programs.\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance Participation**\\n\\nEvmos on-chain governance participation rate is currently the highest among the top Cosmos chains (as of data pulled Oct. 8th, 2022) and is barely managing to maintain an upward trend.

Research & Development Fund\\n\\nAs over 109 million tokens sit idly in the Community Pool, the DAO wishes to utilize a relatively small portion in its continued efforts to advance the Evmos ecosystem. As the main driving force in the community-led growth of Evmos, we hope that the Community is able to see our vision in what is possible with a workable treasury.\\n\\nECP-3 (WIP) lays out our strategic and ambitious programs that will pave the path for a self-sustainable DAO with mechanisms designed to decentralize decision-making, incentivize governance participation, and assist with network decentralization.\\n\\nWhile most of the underlying research has been conducted, the implementation, development, auditing, and testing of the GOV ecosystem will require a considerable amount of resources. \\n\\nOur goal is to roll out each program detailed in ECP-3 in a modular basis with the veGOV and Liquidity Incentives Gauge program as first priority (target launch date of mid-late Q1 2023). We have already initiated discussions with developers and DAOs with experience in the creation of similar DeFi programs, and we fully intend to collaborate with and compensate for the assistance received. \\n\\nThe R&D funding requests are rough estimates; unused funds will remain in the workstream treasury as reserves.\\n\\n**R&D Fund Request**\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| 1 | Smart Contract Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the core contracts that make up the ecosystem of our initiatives | 200,000 EVMOS |\\n| 2 | Dashboard Development  | Funds allocated for the development of the front-end dashboard that will allow users to interact with our contracts |50,000 EVMOS     |\\n| 3 | Parameter Testing  | Funds utilized in the testing and tweaking of the protocol parameters to optimize incentives and confirm feasibility | 25,000 EVMOS  |\\n| 4 | Audits  | Funds allocated for smart contract auditing pre-launch. | 50,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total  |  | 325,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\n#### C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund\\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund will be the precursor to the eventual Perpetual Bounty Fund detailed in ECP-3. While the core concept of a self-replenishing fund through delegation is the same, the Bootstrap Fund will have to be manually managed until the deGOV program and Delegation Gauges are ready to be deployed. \\n\\nThe Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund is currently seeded with a $50,000 grant from the Foundation.\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **300,000 EVMOS** for the strengthening of the Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund. 200K will be delegated on the network, which equates to roughly 25,000 EVMOS / month that will be used for bounties and community initiatives. 100K will be kept in reserves for usage in micro-grants and liquidity bootstrapping assistance for new projects deploying on the Evmos network.\\n\\n\\n#### D. Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams\\n\\nThe Governance Council is requesting **600,000 EVMOS** to be allocated for treasury diversification into stablecoins. The obtained stablecoins will be reserved for Workstream & subDAO members' compensation. \\n\\nDiversification methodology: we are currently exploring a DAO2DAO token-for-stable swap with Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market. \\n\\nWhen an opportunity for a token-stable swap is not available at a moment when the Treasury is in need of stables, no more than 50K Evmos from the Diversification Fund can be sold on the open market per month.\\n\\n### Total Funding Request for Phase 1\\n\\n| # | Purpose | Description | Req. Amount |\\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |\\n| A | Funding Governance Workstream | Retroactive compensation and long-term vesting for Council. **Base compensation to come out of Item D.** | 606,000 EVMOS |\\n| B | Research & Development | The development of the initiatives and programs listed in ECP-3. |325,000 EVMOS     |\\n| C | Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund  | Alpha implementation of the self-replenishing bounty fund and project bootstrapping for the Evmos ecosystem. | 300,000 EVMOS  |\\n| D | Treasury Diversification & Future Workstreams  | DAO2DAO swaps for stablecoins to be used for funding the compensation of current and future workstreams. | 600,000 EVMOS     |\\n|  | Total Requested  |  | 1,831,000 EVMOS     |\\n\\nThe Governance Council treasury will be deployed as a Gnosis Safe with a 4-of-6 configuration on Evmos mainnet. \\n\\nUpon the initiation of Phase 2 funding as detailed in ECP-3, the Council Treasury will be repurposed or a new contract will be deployed as the main Evmos DAO Treasury. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Appendix \\n\\n**Future Workstream Leaders / Council Directors** \\n\\nWe are looking for full-time contributors to fill the following roles. The goal of these full-time contributor roles is to find the next leaders that will step up and establish their own workstreams. \\n\\n - Department of Education\\n \\n     - The mission of the Department of Education is to develop, maintain, and promote educational contents and programs for the Evmos Community. \\n     - This includes the creation of interactive educational content in governance related topics, and eventually the creation of technical content for developers.\\n\\n - Department of Communications\\n\\n     - The Department of Communications is responsible for creating and coordinating direct dialogue between the Evmos DAO and the diverse Community Members.\\n     - Through outreach, communication, townhall meetings, and official announcements from the Governance Council and the various workstreams of the DAO, the Dept. of Communications removes obstacles and barriers and creates opportunities to improve public awareness and involvement in the DAO.\\n     - The Department of Communications will also be responsible for the creation of documentation and communication channels in non-English languages.\\n     - The Department of Communications helps build and maintain the transparent, responsible, and accountable governance system that the Constitution calls for.\\n\\n - Department of Growth & Outreach\\n\\n     - The Department of Growth will be responsible for the strategic outreach and engagement of developers, projects, and other DAOs for the purpose of ecosystem growth.\\n     - Through the generation of leads, coordination with biz dev, outreach campaigns, and strategic bounties, the Department of Growth should ramp up community engagement, elevate the Evmos brand and awareness, illustrate our vision, mission, and values, and enable the facilitation of easy onboarding of projects and developers.\\n\\n - Department of Research & Development\\n\\n     - The Department of R&D will work closely with the Governance Council to research, develop, and maintain key infrastructure, public goods, and the development of smart contracts. \\n\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:24:36.767Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T18:40:43.190Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-09T18:40:43.190Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-12T21:35:14.858Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-11-17T18:44:56.530Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[{"id":47097,"address":"evmos1u0qpyh04ufyyt6q0vqj7pjwk6k0j2mjm353zsj","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-08-17T23:27:19.209Z","keytype":null,"name":"benny lava","last_active":"2022-11-19T21:41:31.336Z","user_id":43496,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":40779,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":43496,"Collaboration":{"address_id":47097,"thread_id":7444,"created_at":"2022-11-03T07:38:12.800Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T07:38:12.800Z","AddressId":47097,"ThreadId":7444}}],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nOne of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. The long-term vision and goals for how workstreams operate are:\n\n - All subDAOs will take care of their own internal governance, compensation, and allocation of responsibilities (leadership roles within the subDAO are encouraged when practical)\n - All subDAOs will be aligned with the main DAO in the goals and mission listed in the Constitution. \n - All subDAOs will be responsible for providing updates to the community and remaining as transparent as possible. \n - All subDAOs will constantly self-assess its performance and efficiency, making adjustments and personnel changes if needed. \n - All subDAOs will help the main DAO in identifying key organizational needs and bottlenecks that needs to be addressed\n\nHowever, the need for more infrastructure, education, and tooling in order to achieve these goals is recognized and is something that the Governance Council is constantly looking to improve. \n\n**Motivation**: The motives for a highly efficient, well-funded, and self-governing community should come as no surprise. An engaged community is a healthy community, and all contributors and participants in the Evmos ecosystem is a stakeholder. The DAO has the ability to engage with the community at large in ways that no centralized entity can; as we try to iron out our current inefficiencies, we will do so in a way that the community can participate in. \n\n---\n\n## 1. Definition and Purpose\n\nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation & Support, Marketing & Creative Services, etc).\n\nWorkstreams are the sub-units of how Evmos DAO advances its purpose. A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos' [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community-run initiatives. As such, ratifying workstreams sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Evmos DAO's governance.\n\n## 2. Workstream Requirements\n\nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered “informal.” A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n - Have a clear objective that aligns with Evmos' values and objectives as listed in the \n - Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on existing workstreams.\n - The specific KPI that the sub-DAO will focus on driving success in\n - The actual work that the sub-DAO will undertake to drive toward the KPI\n - Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing outcomes and all in line with the ECP framework. \n\n\n## 3. Workstream Formation Process\n\nWorkstreams can be formed through the [Evmos Community Proposal Framework](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals). The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the [Workstream component template.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates#d-workstreams--special-initiatives)\n\nThe burden falls mostly on the proposers of the subDAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Evmos Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.\n\nA great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.\n\n## 4. Workstream Stages\n\nWorkstreams have four potential states. The states of each stages are outlined below:\n\n - Informal\n - Proposed\n - Active\n - Inactive\n\n\n## 5. Contributor Compensation Model\n\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n\n**Compensation Principles**\n\nThe Compensation Model is based on the following core principles:\n\n1) **Meritocracy**: all contributors’ positions and compensation should be earned from substantial contributions to the DAO.\n2) **Accountability**: all contributors shall be held accountable for the duties and responsibilities bestowed upon them by the Community\n3) **Recognition**: Early contributors, past contributions, and outstanding work should be recognized and rewarded.\n4) **Scalable**: the model should be able to adjust and properly accommodate new contributors as the DAO grows.\n5) **Competitive**: compensation rates should be competitive with market rates\n6) **Retention**: the model should be designed to align contributors with the long-term goals of the DAO. Talented and dedicated members should want to remain working with the DAO.\n\n**Compensation Types**\n\n1) **Retroactive Compensation**: compensation and rewards for previous contributions made to the DAO. There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \n\n**Compensation Eligibility**\n\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. \n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment\n- The monthly compensation amount\n- Compensation rationale (base and vested)\n\n**Standard Vesting Schedule**: 3-year linear vesting with a 6-month cliff.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmCC9oy.png)\n\nToken vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Pre-Vote","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:19:11.205Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO.

There are two types of retroactive compensations that can be requested: time-based and achievement-based.\\n2) **Base Compensation**: monthly compensation for contributors' fulfillment of expected duties and responsibilities. \\n3) **Vested Compensation**: Revocable compensation in the form of token vesting to encourage long-term commitment, combat contributor burnout, and attract talented contributors. \\n\\n**Compensation Eligibility**\\n\\nCompensation in the scope of the Contributor Compensation Model must be a listed member of a Workstream or subDAO. The contributor's duties and responsibilities must be clearly outlined when the workstream is being proposed for funding, or during the onboarding process of new workstream members. \\n\\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\\n\\n- The role the contributor plays\\n- The weekly time commitment\\n- The monthly compensation amount\\n- Compensation rationale (base and vested)\\n\\n**Standard Vesting Schedule**: 3-year linear vesting with a 6-month cliff.\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmCC9oy.png)\\n\\nToken vesting for contributors are executed on the EVM side. This allows the revocation of the vesting contract through the Gnosis Safe for contributors that are no longer able to fulfill his or her duty.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:19:11.210Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T08:34:53.127Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-01T08:20:16.068Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-12T21:35:14.858Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-11-17T18:44:56.530Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

This document is a condensed version of the ECP Framework; for the full-length version refer to the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAO's Governance system, and provide a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams.\n\nThe Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n\n**Motivation:** The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. The Governance Workstream and the Community have been self-regulating and informally enforcing the general guidelines posted in [“Best Practices”](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) — however, as we prepare to expand the scope and responsibilities of Evmos DAO, we must prepare for another influx of proposals by providing clear guidelines and proposal standardization. \n\nWe strongly believe that our governance participation is among the highest in the blockchain space because of our continued efforts in building a culture of open discussion, strong due diligence, helping one another, and our willingness to assist newcomers navigate the waters of governance. While I am confident that our Community will continue building great culture, a standardized proposal framework and clear lifecycle guideline will ensure that our governance continues on this path for the long-term.\n\n---\n\n# ECP Framework Components\n\n## 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\n\n### Proposal Types\n\n**On-Chain Governance**\n\nOn-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes and takes precedence over the delegated validators of the voter. \n\n\n**Off-Chain Governance**\n\nOff-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. \n\n### Proposal Types by Category\n\n - Protocol Proposals\n - Community Proposals\n - Meta-Governance Proposals\n - Workstreams & Special Initiatives\n - Community Grants & Funding\n - Protocol Incentives & Evmos Specific Proposals\n - Network Upgrades and Security\n\nRefer to the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/definitions) for more details.\n\n\n## 2. The ECP Lifecycle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D8IcfJS.png)\n\n**Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \\[IDEATION\\]**\n\nThe purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. \n\nAnyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.\n\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PRE-PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nPhase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an Evmos Community Proposal and includes all of the criteria specified in the ECP Framework. It must be a clear and complete description of the discussions and ideas held in the previous phase. \n\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\[PROPOSAL\\]**\n\nThe author may finalize the ECP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must add a poll within the thread to gauge the community sentiment.\n\nProposals should only move to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments, responded to all concerns and questions, and believes that the proposal is ready to go on-chain for a final network-wide vote. Proposals in Phase 3 should not be edited further with the exception of minor mistakes. \n\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: \\[VOTING\\]**\n\nIf the signaling polls in Phase 3 show an overall positive sentiment and no major issues are brought up, the proposal may be submitted on-chain for the formal voting. Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\n\n\n### Exceptions to the Framework\n\n**Governance Council**\n\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \"fast-track\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\n\n**Core Developers**\n\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\n\n\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\n\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \n\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\n\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\n\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\n\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Pre-Vote","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:16:21.430Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.185Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework.

The Governance Workstream and the Community have been self-regulating and informally enforcing the general guidelines posted in [“Best Practices”](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6022-passing-a-community-proposal-best-practices) — however, as we prepare to expand the scope and responsibilities of Evmos DAO, we must prepare for another influx of proposals by providing clear guidelines and proposal standardization. \\n\\nWe strongly believe that our governance participation is among the highest in the blockchain space because of our continued efforts in building a culture of open discussion, strong due diligence, helping one another, and our willingness to assist newcomers navigate the waters of governance. While I am confident that our Community will continue building great culture, a standardized proposal framework and clear lifecycle guideline will ensure that our governance continues on this path for the long-term.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# ECP Framework Components\\n\\n## 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\\n\\n### Proposal Types\\n\\n**On-Chain Governance**\\n\\nOn-chain governance refers to all protocol level execution of proposals using Cosmos SDK's `gov` module. Anyone who holds or stakes EVMOS can participate in these votes and takes precedence over the delegated validators of the voter. \\n\\n\\n**Off-Chain Governance**\\n\\nOff-chain governance refers to all community decisions that do not require an on-chain protocol-level change. These types of decisions include a wide variety of topics and concepts, from passing meta-governance proposals to the formation of special task forces or workstreams. \\n\\n### Proposal Types by Category\\n\\n - Protocol Proposals\\n - Community Proposals\\n - Meta-Governance Proposals\\n - Workstreams & Special Initiatives\\n - Community Grants & Funding\\n - Protocol Incentives & Evmos Specific Proposals\\n - Network Upgrades and Security\\n\\nRefer to the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/definitions) for more details.\\n\\n\\n## 2. The ECP Lifecycle\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D8IcfJS.png)\\n\\n**Phase 1: Discussion & Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: \\\\[IDEATION\\\\]**\\n\\nThe purpose of this phase is to vet ideas with the active Evmos community members. Each idea for a proposal should have its own Commonwealth thread, and discussions should be as narrowly focused as possible. \\n\\nAnyone can participate and is encouraged to provide feedback in this phase of governance. The goal of Phase 1 discussion is to gain a rough community consensus, and refine the idea so that it can be formalized. The thread author should make an effort to address all comments and take them into consideration.\\n\\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\\\[PRE-PROPOSAL\\\\]**\\n\\nPhase 2 is where the idea is formalized into an Evmos Community Proposal and includes all of the criteria specified in the ECP Framework. It must be a clear and complete description of the discussions and ideas held in the previous phase. \\n\\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: \\\\[PROPOSAL\\\\]**\\n\\nThe author may finalize the ECP by initiating a community temperature check. To do this, the author must add a poll within the thread to gauge the community sentiment.\\n\\nProposals should only move to Phase 3 once the author has considered all community comments, responded to all concerns and questions, and believes that the proposal is ready to go on-chain for a final network-wide vote. Proposals in Phase 3 should not be edited further with the exception of minor mistakes. \\n\\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: \\\\[VOTING\\\\]**\\n\\nIf the signaling polls in Phase 3 show an overall positive sentiment and no major issues are brought up, the proposal may be submitted on-chain for the formal voting. Submission guidelines [are listed here.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission)\\n\\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tI2JRp6.png)\\n\\n\\n### Exceptions to the Framework\\n\\n**Governance Council**\\n\\nThe Evmos DAO Governance Council may \\\"fast-track\\\" a proposal onto on-chain voting for time-sensitive and urgent matters. The Council must be prepared to explain to the community regarding the decision. If the community deems that the decision was made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to engage in discussions and hold the responsible parties accountable through disciplinary actions or in extreme cases the removal of a Council member through an on-chain vote.\\n\\n**Core Developers**\\n\\nCore developers are not bound to the ECP Framework for network and protocol related proposals. It is expected, however, that thorough testing and due diligence be performed by the developers for all network upgrades. It should be noted, however, that network upgrades must still go through the process of on-chain voting.\\n\\n\\n## 3. ECP Standards and Templates\\n\\n### Standardized Proposal Templates\\n\\nThe Evmos Governance Framework allows for various different types of proposals, both on-chain and off-chain. All proposals must include the core components of the template. Depending on the proposal type, additional components may be required. \\n\\nSome proposal templates can be found in the [Governance Documentation.](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/templates) The Governance Council currently plans to improve the template system through a guided proposal creation dashboard.\\n\\n## 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\\n\\nSubmission guidelines and tips can be found in the [Governance Documentation](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals/submission) as well as the official [Developers Documentation](https://evmos.dev).\\n\\nProposals that have not followed the guidelines will most likely be rejected by the Community. If a proposal is made in bad faith, the Community is encouraged to vote `No with Veto`.\\n\\nWe strongly encourage all proposers to first submit it on testnet to check the formatting and deposit amount. Do not hesitate to reach out to a Governance Council member for review.\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T08:16:21.436Z","updated_at":"2022-11-13T08:38:22.758Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-13T08:29:06.790Z","Address":{"id":41096,"address":"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-11-12T21:35:14.858Z","keytype":null,"name":"LPX","last_active":"2022-11-17T18:44:56.530Z","user_id":42566,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":39849,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":42566},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":2420,"name":"2.

I strongly urge the Evmos Community to make time to read and understand the core concepts and philosophies surrounding these proposals. \n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified *Guiding Values*. \n\nEach proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. \n\nThe following lists the proposals being presented.\n\n - ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n - ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework \n - ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council (Phase 1)\n - ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n - ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)*\n - ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 to be finalized and presented Q1 2023.*\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos Foundation is becoming harder to manage. \n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years. It's time for the Community to step up and assist in growing our ecosystem.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/958lw35.png)\n\n---\n\n### ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n\n**Summary**: All community proposals that go on-chain for voting must first go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework. The proposal lifecycle is designed to have technical, human, and procedural elements for a self-sustainable governance that holds the entire Evmos Community accountable for the continued growth of the ecosystem. \n\nA strong proposal framework is arguably the most important component of our governance, as proposals are the main drivers of the future of our network. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeigm37ad5mo4pmzw3lzffo2zw2ioy2ildjyrn5ewzcra5ud3ewejkm.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1A_%20Formalizing%20the%20Evmos%20Community%20Proposal%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1A.md) | [Full Version](https://gov.evmos.community/governance/proposals)\n\n### ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively. \n\nWorkstreams and subDAOs are key in “scaling a DAO” and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations.\n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeidwqgwhyyaiuylgtow3yadbpewhc4mpsrokxz4vcbci3ra2biihom.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-1B_%20Formalizing%20the%20Workstream%20(subDAO)%20and%20Compensation%20Framework.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1B.md) \n\n---\n\n### ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Council Workstream \n\n**Summary**: Decentralized governance is a double-edged sword with constant challenges to overcome and is often burdened with inefficient processes. It is also the beauty and soul of a DAO, with the ethos of decentralization and equality at the very core. The Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos’ governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Governance Workstream that has been serving the Evmos DAO and the Community for nearly half a year is finally requesting formalization by funding. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeifow6l7eqkjsib3lbb4qd4hqd3bfz7bs6qagkcezxcofwcgj4avay.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-2A_%20Formalizing%20and%20Funding%20the%20Governance%20Council%20Workstream.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md) \n\n### ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod & Support Workstream\n\n**Summary**: The community is the heart and soul of any project. The strength of a community’s network effect is not only determined by quantity, but the value of their interactions - it’s the face of the ecosystem. The Evmos Community Moderation and Support Workstream is a continuation of the work which began in late 2021 voluntarily. With over 30,000 Discord and 19,000 Telegram members, both platforms must be maintained professionally at the highest quality possible 24/7. \n\nThe CMS Workstream that has been serving the Evmos Community is requesting formalization by funding.\n\n[Proposal in Progress]\n\n---\n\n### ECP-3: Empowering the Community and Building a Sustainable Treasury (Phase 2)\n\n**Summary**: Our long term vision for Evmos DAO is to be fully decentralized and governed autonomously by the community. But getting to that ideal vision of a “true” DAO while maintaining effective governance is not a simple task nor is there a cookie-cut method to follow. DAOs are still in the very early days of trying to figure out which mechanisms and processes work best — even the most seemingly established and respected DAOs are constantly iterating their governance process.\n\nThe Phase 2 funding of the DAO’s treasury will mark the beginning of a new era for the Evmos network. Staying true to our core values of progressive decentralization and autonomy, the projects detailed in ECP-3 will empower the community through the decentralization and incentivization of off-chain governance while strengthening our network through Community-Owned Liquidity. \n\nLinks: Commonwealth | [HTML](https://bafybeiefigelbbaig7wznmhum62m6cdao3uza7ra27ovxhcbf5jrddkm5i.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-3_%20Empowering%20the%20Community%20and%20Building%20a%20Sustainable%20Treasury.html) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-3.md)\n\n---\n\n### ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program\n\n**Summary**: The Foundation has voiced its desire to pass the torch for the development and funding of ecosystem grants to the DAO. Although there is yet to be a formal decision or agreement, the Governance Council has shared its vision for a decentralized, transparent, and responsible grants program. \n\nWhile we propose to create a Grants Committee to overlook the program, much like our Liquidity Incentives 2.0 proposed in ECP-3, we seek to design a system in which the community has part-ownership via the democratization of grants. We refuse to allow Community Funds to be managed by a third-party entity that operates with little transparency.\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Informational","url":null,"topic_id":2420,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-11-01T08:13:44.161Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1898ukgfpkxpd79kxk2tz3r9wdvl406cwfzeppf\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"LPX\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-26T23:45:50.963Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"# ECP-0: Proposals to Advance Governance and Support the Growth of Evmos DAO and the Network Ecosystem\\n\\n**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\\n\\n**Summary:** The following proposals are the culmination of thousands of hours of research and calculated deliberation.

on Words and Concepts\n\nWords are a form of cached consensus between individuals/groups and the larger society.\n\nConsensus on words and concepts (since they serve as cache) should be next to

If they are neologisms, their lemma will be updated in governance texts according to (2) and (3) as soon as those sources get to contain the words or/and concepts.\n\nThe exact link between words and concepts is not required for each word of a gov proposal, but the links have to be resolved by the proposer for each and every challenge (in the off-chain proposal discussions) of the meaning of a word or punctuation sign that may substantially change the global meaning of any gov proposal.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Laurel Project Governance .

Once the proposal is approved by the EVMOS governance, the ERC-20 uses a factory pattern to deploy an ERC20 token contract representation of the TGD coin. More info regarding the x/erc20 module [here](https://medium.com/evmos/introducing-evmos-erc20-module-f40a61e05273). \\n\\nMain benefits: \\n- Users will be able to swap EVMOS <-> TGD on Evmos. \\n- Evmos will have access to DeFi protocols build with CosmWasm, on Tgrade and Tgrade will have access to Evmos DeFi.\\n- Tgrade is business-focused and builds a chain compatible with EU regulations while still remaining decentralized. \\n\\nJSON:\\n```\\n{\\n \\\"description\\\": \\\"The native staking and governance token of the Tgrade chain\\\",\\n  \\\"denom_units\\\": [\\n        {\\n            \\\"denom\\\": \\\"ibc/46AB1362B4446BCE0FD7D2F247FFCA8CC39BC6CA7AEAD03C77CABBD1CB41E5C9\\\",\\n            \\\"exponent\\\": 0,\\n            \\\"aliases\\\": [\\\"utgd\\\"]\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \\\"denom\\\": \\\"TGD\\\",\\n            \\\"exponent\\\": 6\\n        }\\n\\n    ],\\n    \\\"base\\\": \\\"ibc/46AB1362B4446BCE0FD7D2F247FFCA8CC39BC6CA7AEAD03C77CABBD1CB41E5C9\\\",\\n    \\\"display\\\": \\\"TGD\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Tgrade\\\",\\n    \\\"symbol\\\": \\\"TGD\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":"","has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-11-08T20:21:53.202Z","updated_at":"2022-11-12T22:21:36.953Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-11-12T22:21:36.953Z","Address":{"id":48221,"address":"evmos17ucx8wx9mz9f2a4ccum536gthydprcumuchveh","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-07-31T18:07:19.415Z","keytype":null,"name":"Loredana","last_active":"2022-11-21T17:26:33.514Z","user_id":37231,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":34514,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":37231},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":1161,"name":"4.

thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place. Community members have expressed concerns over this, and have proposed moving back the decay date to a later date and to reimburse the decayed tokens.\n\nPLAN OF ACTION\n\nWe delay the start of the Rektdrop decay to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022.\n\nSignal commitment to reimburse anyone who experienced decay on their airdrop before the newly set date of Monday August 1st, 2022 .

all,\n\nI want to start a discussion on enabling the inflation module on Evmos Mainnet.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted.\n\nAfter the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\nensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n\ngive more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling the inflation module would mean, that\n\nstaking rewards,\n\nusage incentives and\n\ncommunity pool allocation\n\nare enabled.\n\nTesting on Testnet\n\nWith proposal 28 the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\nstaking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n\ninteracting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts. The incentives pool fills up once a day through inflation\n\nquerying the community pool: a part of inflation is allocated in the community pool once a day. Query the community pool to make sure it's increasing according to the Evmos Token Model .\n\nNote, that the team allocation of the Evmos Token Model is not handled through inflation but instead was implemented with vesting accounts .\n\nDiscussion\n\nBefore voting on the Mainnet proposal please follow and discuss this proposal on this page.

post is somewhat related to and goes some way towards addressing the concerns brought up in this post.\n\nAssuming an average 6.5s block time on mainnet (evmos_9001-2), active validators can get away with only signing half of the blocks in a ~54 hour window without being slashed. In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\n\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\n\nSignedBlocksWindow : change from \"30000\" to \"10000\".\n\nMinSignedPerWindow : change from \"0.500000000000000000\" to \"0.050000000000000000\"\n\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window. You can find out more about the slashing module in the corresponding specification . For reference, these are the current Evmos params:\n\nevmosd query slashing params --node=https://tendermint.bd.evmos.org:26657/ --output=json | jq . { \"signed_blocks_window\": \"30000\", \"min_signed_per_window\": \"0.500000000000000000\", \"downtime_jail_duration\": \"1800s\", \"slash_fraction_double_sign\": \"0.100000000000000000\", \"slash_fraction_downtime\": \"0.005000000000000000\" }\n\nThe proposed values are similar to those of the Cosmos Hub (you can see all Cosmos Hub params here ):\n\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.cosmos.network/cosmos/slashing/v1beta1/params\" -H \"accept: application/json\" { \"params\": { \"signed_blocks_window\": \"10000\", \"min_signed_per_window\": \"0.050000000000000000\", \"downtime_jail_duration\": \"600s\", \"slash_fraction_double_sign\": \"0.050000000000000000\", \"slash_fraction_downtime\": \"0.000100000000000000\" } }\n\nI imagine that some leniency is still necessary early on, given the recent pains with network congestion and the absolutely monstrous rate of state bloat Evmos validators have had to deal with. As active validators acclimate to the challenges of running a chain like Evmos, I imagine the community will want to increase the MinSignedPerWindow .\n\nUnlike other parameter change proposals, we should NOT make the same proposal to testnet (evmos_9000-4) as both test and main networks have different uptime expectations from their validators and slashing carries different consequences.\n\nThoughts?","kind":"discussion","stage":"Discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1177,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-05-10T10:08:43.276Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1xh988wu3eheg3rkydzt5udf4ln6hfrqnevkl27\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"evmychan ☄️\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Love EVM, Love Cosmos\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/7f6c999b-36d7-4b15-950f-a6442e25c368.png\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-05-09T08:25:44.428Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"This post is somewhat related to and goes some way towards addressing the concerns brought up in \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true,\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4744-extend-claims-period-by-21-days\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"this\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"italic\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\" post.\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAssuming an average 6.5s block time on mainnet (evmos_9001-2), active validators can get away with only signing half of the blocks in a ~54 hour window without being slashed.

Even after years of dormancy, the funds are still on the private key, as long as the blockchain exists.\n\nThis decay is a nasty thing to do, and so I am asking the question: how realistic is a proposal to remedy the situation? For instance: everyone who would have had an EVMOS airdrop claim, will receive their decayed funds retroactively, without further activity needed from the user side? This could be achieved by an automatic process running at a given date, e.g. end of 2022, or by a permanent link on the dashboard. To keep things simple, entering an address (cosmos or evmos) and hitting \"claim\" should be enough. So no need to maintain a complicated rektdrop dashboard over the long term.\n\nCurrently, the unclaimed funds will be returned to the community wallet, but for what purpose? Pissing off users who missed the deadline, are much less likely to use the project in the future.

Even after years of dormancy, the funds are still on the private key, as long as the blockchain exists.\\\\n\\\\nThis decay is a nasty thing to do, and so I am asking the question: how realistic is a proposal to remedy the situation? For instance: everyone who would have had an EVMOS airdrop claim, will receive their decayed funds retroactively, without further activity needed from the user side? This could be achieved by an automatic process running at a given date, e.g. end of 2022, or by a permanent link on the dashboard. To keep things simple, entering an address (cosmos or evmos) and hitting \\\\\\\"claim\\\\\\\" should be enough. So no need to maintain a complicated rektdrop dashboard over the long term.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, the unclaimed funds will be returned to the community wallet, but for what purpose? Pissing off users who missed the deadline, are \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"much \\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"less likely to use the project in the future. This will cause more loss of value to the token, than the returned funds will be worth.\\\\n\\\"}]}\"}"],"snapshot_proposal":null,"has_poll":null,"created_at":"2022-09-29T21:39:34.467Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T16:20:00.400Z","deleted_at":null,"last_commented_on":"2022-10-04T16:20:00.400Z","Address":{"id":60772,"address":"evmos1x8lrmjhtncl2r7xjt978wv5vpluvyg06yfm2u2","chain":"evmos","verified":"2022-09-29T20:57:52.398Z","keytype":null,"name":null,"last_active":"2022-09-29T21:39:34.476Z","user_id":58518,"is_councillor":false,"is_validator":false,"ghost_address":false,"profile_id":55800,"wallet_id":"cosm-metamask","UserId":58518},"collaborators":[],"topic":{"id":952,"name":"1.

GRANT PROPOSAL // PARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nOne Sentence Description: “Sequester-To-Earn” Platform that incentivizes climate action\n\nWebsite:  www.avatree.xyz\n\nTwitter/IG: @_avatree\n\nMISSION AND VISION\n\nAvatree is a “Sequester-To-Earn” platform where people are incentivized to take climate action.\n\nWe see climate change as a collective coordination problem. Since web3 has been incredibly effective at solving such problems, our vision is to adapt key learnings from web3 to onboard millions of people to the climate movement and accelerate carbon sequestration efforts worldwide.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe user purchases a subscription of carbon credits along with an Avatree NFT, which is a digital sapling. As the user makes their monthly payments to purchase carbon credits, the sapling grows algorithmically and fruits Avatree tokens. This token can be spent to personalize their Avatree NFT, attend IRL / online events and purchase brand rewards. Alternatively the user can trade their tokens on the open market for cash.\n\nBUSINESS MODEL\n\nWe earn money by:\n\n1. Charging for Avatree NFTs - $25-$100/each, 100% margin\n\n2. Monthly carbon credit subscription - $10-$100/month, 3.5% margin\n\n3. NFT Resale Revenue - 5% of resale\n\nTEAM\n\nChetan Nandakumar - CEO/Product:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnandakumar\n\n• 10+ years as PM and ML engineer at companies such as Recruitbot & Leap Motion\n\n• Co-founder of Modista.com - computer vision for apparel search\n\n• UC Berkeley PhD in AI & Neuroscience, NSF Graduate Fellow\n\nTyler Streeter - Graphics Engineer:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerstreeter/\n\n• Founder of iBonsai iOS app, 120K total downloads, 55K paid downloads\n\n• PhD in AI, MS in VR from Iowa State University\n\n• Portfolio: http://tyl.st/projects/\n\nAnusheel Bhushan - Full Stack Engineer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusheel/\n\n• Founder of Strive Labs.\n\n• Principal Engineer, eBay\n\n• BS IIT Delhi, MS UC Irvine\n\nChris Znerold - Design Lead:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/znerold/\n\n• Founder of Stay.Gold Design Firm: www.stay.gold\n\n• Design Lead at AirBnB, Apple Music & Disney Interactive\n\n• Creative Director at PlayStation\n\n• Portfolio:  http://znerold.com/\n\nADVISORS\n\nBradley Horowitz, VP Product at Google:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradleyhorowitz/\n\n• VP Product at Google\n\n• Former head of GMail, GCalendar, Google Voice, and many other Google teams\n\n• MIT Media Alum\n\nPhilip Taylor, Climate Scientist:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipgrahamtaylor/\n\n• Climate Fellow at UC Boulder\n\n• Founder Mad Agriculture - helping farmers turn their operations to being regenerative\n\n• PhD from UC Boulder in Climate Science\n\nPARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nRegen Network is a blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem and a leading provider of carbon and ecological credits in the ReFi space. They will serve as a key partner with us, providing us with the carbon credits that power our platform, and promoting us to their community.\n\nHOW CAN WE BE SURE THESE CREDITS ARE REAL?\n\nThe carbon credit / ecological credit industry holds a lot of potential to support climate restoration, but it’s also a new, unregulated industry and ripe with abuse.\n\nWe take this issue seriously and are taking the following measures to ensure that the credits purchased through our platform contribute to tangible and meaningful climate action:\n\n1. We will only be selecting those credits that match the following criteria:\n\nNature based - restoring ecological habitats\n\nClear and proven additionality - a given habitat would not have been restored without additional funding\n\nMeasurable impact - can the activities to preserve or regenerate ecology be measured and confirmed? What are the downstream outcomes from this land preservation or restoration (ie. improvements in soil health, biodiversity, water quality, etc)\n\n2. Regen Network, our supplier for carbon credits, is a pioneer in this ReFi industry and is leading the way for high-end ecological credits and industry standards. Here’s are links to articles about some of their carbon credits:\n\nNCT, Nature Carbon Tonne:  https://medium.com/regen-network/introducing-nature-carbon-ton-nct-6d0fbaaf490d\n\nCarbonPlus Grasslands credits:  https://registry.regen.network/methodologies/carbonplus-grasslands\n\n3. Phil Taylor (see above), a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur, has joined our team as an advisor and will be guiding our carbon credit strategy\n\n4. Using web3 increases transparency around these credits. Each credit will be on-chain and labeled with its location, the person/agency who created the credit, the independent verifier, related images, etc.\n\nMARKET TRENDS\n\n• NFTs grew 23x from 2020 to 2021 into a $23B industry\n\n• The voluntary carbon market will grow 15x and will be worth upwards of $50B by 2030\n\n• There are 10+ consumer carbon offset products on the market, but none have garnered widespread adoption (see “Competition” section below)\n\nCORE ASSUMPTION\n\nOur core assumption is that there’s a massive untapped market of individuals who want to take climate action but just need a nudge to do so. We believe that nudge consists of social and financial incentives.\n\nCOMPETITION & UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nThere is a burgeoning demand for carbon offsetting products from consumers, and there are 10+ consumer-oriented carbon offsetting products on the market attempting to meet this need.\n\nSome of the key players in our space are Klima, Wren (YC and Union Square Ventures backed), Joro (Sequoia Backed), and Terrapass. All these products take a dry, individualized approach to carbon offsetting. They ask the user questions to assess their carbon footprint, and then allow them to offset it by purchasing a monthly subscription of carbon credits.\n\nAlthough these products have engaged hundreds of thousands of people, none of them have garnered widespread adoption, leaving open a massive market opportunity. The existing products have poor UX without any gamification or integrated social engagement. By creating a social, incentivized solution, Avatree aims to seize this market opportunity.\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nWe will grow our user base through web3 and web2 strategies such as community building through Discord / Twitter spaces / influencer engagement, and social media marketing.\n\nAlso, by addressing climate, a topic of growing global concern, we can leverage existing communities in the climate space. Since Avatree is a monetized platform, we can sign on these organizations as affiliates, so that they get paid when their members sign up for Avatree.\n\nTRACTION\n\nWe launched a preview of our algorithmic tree at  VERSE , an augmented reality art gallery in SF and Denver. Visitors experience the Avatree exhibit as a 16ft 3D hologram that grows from sapling to tree in 4 minutes. We're on display alongside top-end artists such as Android Jones and Zed Run and have become a \"crowd favorite\" of the gallery. Since February, VERSE has had 15K guests in SF and Denver and will be expanding to 15 locations around the world in 2022.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n- Accepted to the 2022 Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator, a non-dilutive accelerator, 6% acceptance rate\n\n- Accepted to the World Economic Forum's 2022 Crypto Impact and Sustainability Accelerator & Crypto Sustainability Coalition\n\nWORKING PROTOTYPE\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pde95ir1u4s24o3/avatree-video.mp4?dl=0\n\nDECK\n\nhttps://docsend.com/view/nvdvw6q4nyuqkvtp\n\nTECHNICAL ROADMAP\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mrwi491mpv522y1/Avatree%20Tech%20Roadmap.pdf?dl=0\n\nMILESTONES\n\nMilestone 1, Initial Kickoff, Nov 1, 2022\n\nMilestone 2, Dec 15, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm for single growing tree\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 1 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 3, Feb 1, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm that can grow multiple trees\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 2 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 4, Mar 15, 2023, $20k\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 3 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\n- Public Launch of Avatree Product to Potential Consumers\n\nTOTAL: $100k\n\nHEADCOUNT BREAKDOWN\n\nFull Stack Engineer, 16 weeks, Full-time, $45/hr, $28.8k\n\nBlockchain Engineer, 12 weeks, Full-time, $60/hr, $28.8k\n\nGraphics/AI Engineer, 8 weeks, Full-time, $70/hr, $20.6\n\nDesigner, 16 weeks, Quarter-time, $70/hr, $12k\n\nSmart Contract / Backend Testing and Revision - $10k\n\nBENEFIT TO EVMOS\n\nWhen we launch the platform (in March 2023) we anticipate selling 2k-5k NFTs. Pricing them at the lower end of the scale, this would translate to $50k-$125k in EVMOS tokens. Additionally, if each person purchases ~$10 in carbon credits per month, this translates to $20k - $50k in carbon credits purchased each month on COSMOS\n\nIn one year, we anticipate increasing our userbase to 10k-25k users. So this would translate to $250k-$625k in EVMOS tokens. And then more as we continue to grow the network in the next few years.\n\nFYI, an important distinction with our model is that there is no cap to the the number of NFTs we mint. The financial incentives for participation center around the token rewards generated by the NFTs. Our vision is for this to be a consumer product with hundreds of thousands of users in the years ahead\n\nFUTURE EXPANSION\n\nAfter the completion of this grant, Avatree will continue to expand its userbase and product offerings.

everyone! \n\nThe last [Evmos Software Upgrade to `v5.0.0`](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/29) did not pass governance, because we noticed on Testnet that the upgrade required some fixes. This is a good example of the importance of testing upgrades in a testnet environment. The main issue that we discovered was that Metamask transactions could not be submitted, because the UI didn't allow large differences between the base fee and the min gas price. \n\nThis thread is following up with scheduling the `v6.0.1` software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [1,042,000\n](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/1042000) (Estimated Target Date: Mon Jul 04 2022 19:16:07 GMT+0200 ) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v6.0.1](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v6.0.1). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v6.0.1` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters.\n* Allow Metamask transactions with min gas price\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop.
