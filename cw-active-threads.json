wide variety of web3 public goods (such as tools, plugins and educational content) provide necessary infrastructure essential to the growth of blockchain ecosystems.\n\nMost web3 public goods and open-source software rely on donations to fund their work. With the introduction of crypto, much has been done to complement the traditional donation process (i.e individuals and/or charities raise funds in order to donate to causes) including the introduction of crypto-based payments, quadratic funding, tokenized rewards to donors, etc.\n\nDespite these evolutions, donations are still made by giving money from your available capital to a public good. This results in an opportunity cost whereby donors forgo financial gain in favor of supporting a charity or cause. For smaller donors with lesser wealth, continuing to donate in this way may be more daunting as it relies on their ability to replenish their principal.\n\nThrough The Orb, we change this paradigm by introducing a novel way to fund web3 public goods. Instead of donating principal to public goods, donors allocate a portion of their yield from staked capital. This injects capital back into the ecosystem and enables donors to participate in a predictable, long-term manner.\n\nIn order to compensate for the donated yield, The Orb compounds yield to achieve a much higher APY. It also issues Orb governance tokens so donors get a say in which projects are funded, and awards donors with NFT, swag, etc. to channel natural reward/status seeking behavior into public goods.\n\nIn the prevailing staking model, proof-of-stake facilitates the extraction of financial value to stakers, but only provides limited mechanisms (e.g. restaking) to reinject value back into the ecosystem.\n\nThrough The Orb, stakers can provide essential support needed for the development of foundational technologies such as tools, plugins and educational content.\n\nDonating to these shared resources unlock enormous value as they accelerate adoption by making it easier to onboard developers, dapps and users. This in-turn redistributes value back to all stakeholders, creating a circular economy.\n\nIn this proposal we seek community support to set up The Orb and stake some of the Evmos community’s capital (currently locked by the foundation) through The Orb in order to bootstrap public goods funding within the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDefinition of a web3 public good\n\nThe traditional definition of a public good is a commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society. In web3, the definition of a public good is different. It consists of the following characteristics:\n\nHas longevity: It’s both achievable and indefinitely maintainable.\n\nCreates positive externalities: It benefits a larger audience and goes beyond an immediate set of users.\n\nIs universally accessible: It should be accessible to anyone in the world and is both free to use and open-source.\n\nExamples of public goods\n\nFoundry: A development tool to build Ethereum applications used by many thousands of developers ( https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry )\n\nPOAPs: NFT badges issued to commemorate events such as twitter spaces calls and hundreds of crypto conferences ( https://poap.gallery )\n\nDevpill.me : A community led blockchain development guide ( https://www.devpill.me/ )\n\nLenster: A decentralized, and permissionless social media app ( https://lenster.xyz )\n\nBloom Network: An international community of people and projects creating and nurturing regenerative cultures ( https://bloomnetwork.org/ )\n\nProject overview\n\nMany web3 public goods primarily rely on donations to fund their work. These include developer tools, plugins, extensions and educational content that are managed and maintained by millions of downstream contributors.\n\nGiven the importance of donations, much work has been done in web3 to facilitate the fundraising process. Platforms such as Giveth, Gitcoin and Protocol Guild amongst others have reorganized funding in web3 to be more efficient, transparent and rewarding to donors.\n\nNotable improvements include:\n\nIncreased opportunities for not-for-profit projects to receive donations in crypto\n\nOptimized distribution with seasonal funding rounds and better fund allocation methods such as matching grants, quadratic funding and vesting contracts\n\nImproved incentives through tokenizing contributions and offering donor rewards in the form of financial tokens and NFTs\n\nYet, little has been done to change the traditional model of donation. In the current model, donors incur an opportunity cost in order to support a cause, as they forgo future gains from their principal.\n\nThis can be challenging for many donors with lesser wealth, as it relies on their ability to replenish their principal in order to continue making donations.\n\nIn the prevailing staking model, proof-of-stake extracts financial value to stakers, without providing many mechanisms (aside from restaking) to reinject value back into the ecosystem.\n\nThrough The Orb, we change this paradigm by introducing a novel way to fund web3 public goods.\n\nDonors stake their capital, and allocate a portion of their gains to public goods. This injects capital back into the ecosystem in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nAs a result, donors don't diminish their principal, while participating in a predictable, long-term funding model for public goods.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nBy reinjecting yield into public goods, donors provide the essential support needed for the development of foundational technology such as tools, plugins and educational content that benefit the entire ecosystem continuously and effortlessly.\n\nThese shared resources unlock enormous value as they accelerate adoption by making it easier to onboard more developers, dapps and users.\n\nReinjecting yield from staked capital into an ecosystem redistributes value to all stakeholders, creating a circular economy.\n\nWen ATH? :)\n\n(image)\n\nHow it works\n\nUsers stake Evmos through The Orb Program. They can choose any validator, including any node they are already staking on.\n\nThe Orb program auto-compounds daily on behalf of the user (for a much higher ROI), allocates 15% to the public goods treasury and distributes the rest of the yield back to the user.\n\nFunds are allocated to public goods projects including the Orb, which retains a portion for operating, maintaining and growing the project.\n\nGovernance\n\nFor each Evmos token donated to public goods, donors receive governance tokens.\n\nFunds collected in The Orb Public Goods Treasury are managed by a DAO controlled by donors.\n\nThese tokens allow governance across 3 vectors:\n\nProposals and projects that would receive funding\n\nOrb strategic decisions (operations, fees, legal etc.)\n\nElecting and removing project vetting council members\n\nVision\n\nTo generate predictable, long-term funding for public goods, while securing blockchains and developing ecosystems.\n\nWebsite URL\n\nwww.stakeorb.xyz\n\nFees and Funding Structure\n\nAnyone can deploy funds to any Evmos node and receive 85% of the yield generated as a reward.\n\nThe balance 15%, will be allocated to The Orb public goods treasury.\n\nGovernance token holders will be able to vote on how the funds are allocated.\n\nReturns\n\nReturns will vary based on the block reward Evmos emission schedule. The current APY can be viewed here .\n\nChallenges and Risks\n\nAttacks/Hacks on the ecosystem (blockchain, nodes, bridges, wallets, dapp etc.)\n\nDonating rewards to The Orb when liquid staking is introduced\n\nSlashing events\n\nNode downtime/jailing\n\nAbility to attract public goods\n\nTax concessions (in different jurisdictions)\n\nProject Selection\n\nThe public goods need to directly benefit the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nProjects must also fulfill the criteria set out in the public goods definition section.\n\nAll projects requesting funds and fund emission schedules are subject to approval by governance.\n\nRoadmap\n\nSetup public goods node (2 weeks): Setup the Evmos non-custodial yield optimization app.\n\nSetup The Orb DAO and multi-sig treasury (8 weeks): Setup The Orb DAO, the public goods multisig and The Orb foundation as a not-for-profit entity.\n\nToken airdrop contract (2 weeks): Issue governance tokens to donors.\n\nSetup public goods application process (12 weeks): Setup the applicant website and finalize the fund distribution mechanism.\n\nLaunch Orb grants season 1: Fund first public goods.\n\nTeam\n\nThe team behind The Orb consists of:\n\nSheran (@sheran_sc), Patrick (@iampotrok) and Sam (@samirxcv): Core contributors of Lighthouse DAO (@lighthouse_dao), a decentralized proof-of-contribution protocol for web3 reputation and credentialing. Currently working on bringing the Lighthouse protocol to Evmos.\n\nSebastien Couture (@seb3point0): Founder of Interop Ventures (@InteropVC), host of the Epicenter and The Interop podcasts, currently running Evmos Node “Interop”.\n\nWilliam Mougayar (@wmougayar): Early investor and advisory board member of the Ethereum Foundation, Executive Chairman, Kin Foundation.\n\nJean-Philippe Jabre (@jpjabre1): Founder of Plassa Capital and investor in the Jabcap Family Office interested in public goods funding mechanisms.\n\nRequests\n\n1. Request to channel existing locked capital by the Evmos Foundation through The Orb\n\nThe Evmos foundation recently staked approx. $10M Evmos on medium-sized nodes to promote network decentralization. We would like to explore the possibility of:\n\nRe-staking a portion of the existing delegation to the same mid-sized nodes through The Orb program.\n\nIssue a new delegation of $2M to 5M from the community pool to mid-sized nodes promoting further network decentralization through The Orb program.\n\nStaking through The Orb program has no impact on nodes, but it allocates 15% of the yield to the public goods treasury, which is controlled by Orb token holders.\n\nThe capital staked will not be accessible to us and will be owned by the Evmos community.\n\nThe exact request of funds will be decided based on the outcome of the poll attached to this discussion.\n\n2. Request for funds\n\n120,000 EVMOS vesting over 1 year to bootstrap The Orb foundation. These funds will be used to cover:\n\nDevelopment costs: The funds will be used to develop the non-custodial yield optimization app, token airdrop contracts, grant application process and associated website.\n\nMaintenance costs (during the bootstrap period): The funds will also be used to cover maintenance costs for a period of 1 year. These include patches and updates, monitoring, infrastructure costs etc associated with managing and maintaining Orb services. After 1 year, our goal is to fund this through The Orb DAO (subject to governance) which itself would be a public good.\n\nSetup costs related to The Orb Foundation: The funds will also be used to cover any setup costs including legal fees associated with setting up The Orb Foundation as a not-for-profit entity.\n\nFund allocation breakdown\n\n25% - At the start of the project\n\n50% - At the governance token airdrop event\n\n25% - At The Orb grants S1 launch\n\nFrequently Asked\n\n1. Which nodes will I be able to stake on?\n\nYou can stake on any Evmos node through The Orb program.\n\n2. Will The Orb be set up as a not-for-profit?\n\nYes.\n\n3. Will The Orb be run as an Evmos Workstream / Sub-DAO?\n\nWe are open to the idea! The specific mechanisms need to be discussed.\n\n4. What makes this better than traditional grants programs?\n\nWe purposefully designed The Orb to be a community-centric, egalitarian public good. It is very much a public good for public goods. In this way, our value proposition is what distinguishes us from other grants programs. We allow users and organizations to grow their capital while also creating a steady flow of capital towards a public goods treasury.\n\nThis process aligns incentives for all parties involved: donors/stakers, the public goods projects, The Orb, and the Evmos ecosystem. Furthermore, one-off donations are fleeting as they lack to establish a relationship between the donor and the cause. The Orb, however, offers continuous access to these donors to vote on further funding of projects (and, in turn, the future direction of Evmos) for as long as the user is a part of the DAO\n\n5. Who decides which projects get funded?\n\nThe Orb governance token holders. These tokens can be acquired by anyone contributing to public goods through The Orb.\n\n6. What about early contributors having a lion share of the voting power?\n\nWhile governance tokens are allocated based on contributions to public goods, the exact governance mechanism can be finalized and tweaked as the project progresses.\n\n7. Is The Orb chain specific?\n\nYes. Other than the idea and concept, all operational aspects including governance, project selection, vetting, and funding are all decided by the Evmos community. We hope to foster a culture of public goods that’s specific to Evmos, while learning lessons from other chains and improving the project as a whole for everyone!\n\n8. How will you ensure the safety of the treasury from being exploited & DAO from spam?\n\nThe treasury will be controlled by a multisig and all requests for funding will follow an application process governed by a project vetting council.\n\n9. How would The Orb work in conjunction with Liquid Staking?\n\nIt’s still too early to tell. Two possible solutions are:\n\nWe partner with the liquid staking service so that funds can directly be staked on The Orb\n\nWe re-wrap the synthetic asset and issue our own token\n\nReferences\n\na16z: The web3 landscape October 2021 [ https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-web3-Readlng-List.pdf ]\n\nGitcoin: Seeking a New Kind of Public Good: Open Call for Proposals [ https://gitcoin.co/blog/seeking-a-new-kind-of-public-good/ ]\n\nTen Reasons Why People Don’t Donate to Charity [ https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/common-objections-to-giving/ ]\n\nA Guide To Public Goods for New Web3 Devs [ https://medium.com/ankr-network/a-guide-to-public-goods-for-new-web3-devs-59befc40ae77 ]\n\nFunding Public Goods in web3 for the Uninitiated [ https://jessykate.medium.com/funding-public-goods-in-web3-for-the-uninitiated-27493693c25c ]\n\nRecent discussions\n\nInteroperable Smart Contacts on Cosmos – Jacob Gadikian of Notional Labs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkdKfPVjTss (From 09:00 onward)\n\nMEV in the interchain – Sean Braithwaite of Mekatek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RW8i2vUeuo&t=3232s (From minute 53:52 onward)","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-10-25T16:23:01.467Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1wysd8jm57wnrycnd3tqqyzx5wmwx72gwmtd924\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Sheran\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"@sheran_sc\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-25T16:19:40.991Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Abstract\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"header\\\":1},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nA wide variety of web3 public goods (such as tools, plugins and educational content) provide necessary infrastructure essential to the growth of blockchain ecosystems.\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nMost web3 public goods and open-source software rely on donations to fund their work.

Furthermore, one-off donations are fleeting as they lack to establish a relationship between the donor and the cause.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/flarcos/ )\n\nHabeeb Bombata (twitter) ( https://linkedin.com/in/nottherealillest )\n\nEmail :\n\ninfo@footieszn.com\n\nFunding requested (in USD)\n\n$200,000\n\nTeam Information:\n\nHabeeb Bombata - Operations & Product - previously at Float YCW21, Paxful, Cloudbees, Bento.\n\nGbolahan Onadeko - Product & Engineering - 8+ years blockchain veteran.\n\nDan Mgbor (BENQI co-founder) - Angel investor and Advisor\n\nJesse Ghansah( Float and OMG digital ) - Angel investor and Advisor\n\nThe team behind FootieSZN has been building blockchain-based applications for over 3 years, A few of the Projects the team has previously worked on include :\n\nDappy network : A stablecoin to fiat offramp platform that allows users receive payments across 80+ countries worldwide.\n\nUniversalAPI : A payment clearing platform that allows businesses to send and receive funds.\n\nWhat is FootieSZN:\n\nFootieSzn is a fantasy football game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real-life football players and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. We are currently operating out of the British virgin islands with aspirations to extend operations around the world.\n\nIt is estimated that the 2022 world cup finals in Qatar will be watched by over 5 billion people. At least 8 out of 10 people support one form of sport and are very knowledgeable about it, Football/Soccer fans are estimated to be around 3.5 billion people.\n\nWith almost no learning curve for fans, we are developing a fantasy sports service that enables individuals to participate, earn, and enjoy what they are already fans of.\n\nThe Total number of blockchain users is estimated at around 80m WorldWide, FootieSZN can build a fantasy football gaming experience to tap into such a huge fan base which will be a huge win for the blockchain economy, especially Evmos, Also FootieSZN is not just stopping at Football/Soccer, We plan to expand and create an SZNVerse where we build fantasy for each sport (Cricket, NBA, NFL, Ruby, Baseball, etc).\n\nFootieSZN has been in development for a little over a year, A lot of which has been mostly researching and engineering phases, and in that time we have built out an MVP which we launched on a Testnet in August 2022 with 4,000+ Participants currently. We have been running on a very lean budget, mostly bootstrapped with some help from some Angel Investors.\n\nWe are yet to raise our Pre-Seed/Seed round.\n\nWe are asking the Evmos Community with this proposal to help fund our development to take it to the next level.\n\nWhat is the place of the SZN token?\n\nWe are building toward an SZN Verse that would consist of various fantasy sports.\n\n(Football/Soccer, Basketball, Cricket, Ruby, etc) With each Sport having a large fan base, we are creating a medium of value that would be used in SZN Verse,\n\nSZN is the medium of exchange in SZN Verse.\n\nHow will it gain & maintain the value?\n\nFootieSZN operates a freemium model however Users would be required to use SZN tokens to enhance their experience with different game modes.\n\nBuying function performing NFT like Booster Packs (Triple Captain, Clean Sheet, etc)\n\nBuying cosmetic type NFTs like Managers, Badges, themes, etc\n\nCreating private leagues and pools.\n\nCreating sponsored leagues.\n\nScouts Reports.\n\nPlease note that the above is currently for just Football/Soccer, as we expand into other sports the list of utilities will increase.\n\nOnboarding Users:\n\nOnboarding web2 users is a priority for FootieSZN, We plan to build out an Android & IOS App that will make it easy for regular users to onboard and use FootieSZN easily, Existing Web3 users will also be onboarded but our focus will be on web2 users, by building engineering infrastructure or leveraging existing technologies like Ramper/Arcana to abstract complex details like wallet addresses, etc\n\nUsers will be able to sign up with just their email addresses and no prior crypto gaming experience.\n\nWhy FootieSZN over another fantasy protocol?\n\nFootieSZN intends to stay true to being a traditional fantasy sport protocol, unlike existing Fantasy protocols/ Platforms that require participants to sink a lot of funds to be able to be competitive.\n\nEg: A new user onboarding on SORARE will need an average of $1420 to be averagely competitive in its league system, In FootieSZN player NFTs are free and this removes the onboarding barriers and allow people to enjoy and play the game they love and support while they enhance their experience within their finance.\n\nWhat will this app look like when it’s first ready?\n\nFootieSZN will launch first with Soccer/Football right before the start of the 2023/2024 season then we estimate releasing at least one more sport before the end of 2023.\n\nOur setup which we built Soccer on, allows us to integrate other sports faster, we would estimate around a 6-month development period to launch.\n\nWe will always try to launch a new sport before the season starts.\n\nGame modes in FootieSZN?\n\nThe game mode in the football FootieSZN:\n\nGeneral League: This league is a public league owned by the platform in which everyone can participate.\n\n1V1: Participants on FootieSZN can challenge each other to a single matchday contest where the participant with the highest points wins the pool prize created between the two users.\n\nWorldcup: build your team based on the countries and players participating in the World Cup and contest against other teams.\n\nStoryMode: (Stealth)\n\nGo-to-market strategy / Customer acquisition.\n\nWe believe our strongest customer acquisition path will be the community.\n\nWe're going to focus on growing and engaging a community of fantasy sports fans by\n\nLeveraging and partnering with existing Reddit / discord gaming communities\n\nPartnering with local sport fan bases across multiple teams/stadiums\n\nLeveraging local Facebook and telegram communities\n\nWeekly content, videos, blogs, and engagement on social media\n\nIn-app referral system\n\nPartnering with sports influencers and journalists that already have cult-like followers and community\n\nSponsoring local community sporting events\n\nWeekly twitter spaces, town halls, and more to keep the community engaged.\n\nWhat are the expected costs for the audits, smart contracts, and other features?\n\nWe are actively building and will require more funds as we progress.\n\nWe are estimating costs for product development around $200k, there are also marketing costs and more.\n\nThe estimate for just one of our smart contracts is about $8500 (we have multiple smart contracts)\n\nWill the Evmos community cover all of this?\n\nWe do not expect Evmos to cover all the development costs as we will raise them with VCs as well.\n\nThis initial funding will get us to a place where we can build a fantastic MVP that will change\n\nthe crypto gaming space.\n\nWill you only be fantasy & final outcome prediction, or will you ever move to a full-on Bovata-style betting platform?\n\nBased on the vision we have, we want to build a game people will love and play.\n\nFootieSZN will only be a fantasy, final outcome prediction, and simulation sports platform, We will not be exploring the Bovata style betting because that would require a lot of legal and license requirements and FootieSZN may be restricted in some geographical areas.\n\nCurrently, anyone from anywhere in the world is able to play with FootieSZN because it does not require any form of license to operate.\n\nAfter this funding, will you need any more funds to complete a full-fledged product? Will you be transparent on funds raised from investors & sales vs Evmos community funding\n\nYes, We are looking to raise a seed round of $2.8M(3 years roadmap), we will be interested in the help we can get towards that from EVMOS and the community.\n\nNote: This is after MVP has been shipped on EVMOS.\n\nWill you be airdropping to Stakers or Holders if this passes?\n\nNot at this time.\n\nHave you finished the Q3 markers on your roadmap?\n\nAll Q3 markers are ready for implementation and will be merged soon, Features planned for Q4 are currently in the test phase and will be implemented soon.\n\nBelow is our Roadmap:\n\nQ3 2022:\n\nTestnet EPL\n\nTeam creation\n\nBooster Pack NFTs\n\nQ4 2022:\n\nPay gas in SZN token\n\n1v1 Match\n\nPrivate League\n\nThe world cup (fantasy and prediction)\n\nQ1 2023:\n\nEscrow for core, private and 1v1\n\nQ2 2023:\n\nEnd of Testnet\n\nStart of Mainnet (All Major Leagues)\n\nQ3 2023: SZN VERSE\n\nExpanding into other sports (Cricket, NBA, etc)\n\nHow will FootieSZN bring value to the Evmos ecosystem?\n\nFor every web2 user or player FootieSZN onboard into its platform, they will be exposed to the Evmos Ecosystem.\n\nThe active wallets and Tx count on Evmos should increase with the number of web2 users we plan to reach.\n\nFootieSZN being an active member of the Evmos community will then host Twitter space or events where new projects can be showcased.\n\nWith each of these participants holding value in SZN tokens, it will increase the value held natively in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nBeing a native Evmos token will bring liquidity and transaction volume to the chain\n\nTestnet on EVMOS\n\nFantasy Premier League(testnet)\n\nFantasy Premier League demo video\n\nFantasy gallery\n\nWorldcup predict(testnet)\n\nWorldcup

Evmos Community,\n\nWho Are We:\n\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs ( http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, & more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:\n\nETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n\nDeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n\nETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n\nETH Seattle (July 2023)\n\nETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\nWe are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.\n\nWe expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\n\nTo us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nIn the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\n\nOther sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\nWHY THE CONFERENCES WERE VALUABLE TO EVMOS\n\nBeyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.\n\nWe’re Part Of The Ecosystem:\n\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF & DeFi Bogota.

However, if there's interest in recording Evmos talks at our events, we can include an optional recording package for $30k (= $6k per event across 5 events). With this package, the entire conference will be recorded and we'll post the recordings on youtube for viewers to watch. To thank the Evmos community for their support, for ALL the videos, we'll link to the Evmos site in \"Descriptions\" to help drive traffic. If there's interest in this option, please vote accordingly on the poll.\n\nWe're open to the community's feedback on our event series!","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":true,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-10-18T00:58:21.800Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos19234wkqdcycjzyvp2y327l75ey0elw3z7m0sx2\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"Hsin-Ju w/ Dystopia Labs\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-10-18T00:34:40.048Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Dear Evmos Community,\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Who Are We:\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder & CEO of Dystopia Labs (\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"http://dystopialabs.com).\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"http://dystopialabs.com).\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota.

We had an overall budget of $125k for DeFi Bogota. The venue and catering made up the bulk of the costs. We also worked w/ vendors for AV and furniture setup. We have not sold any of the EVMOS that we received yet.\n\nThankfully, beyond EVMOS, we also received sponsorship from: UMA, Blocknative, 1inch, Figment, Raid Guild, Mask Network, Ellipti, Harmony, Stacks, Rarible, Protocol Labs, Mina, DODOex, and Coinbase.\n\nOur Plans Moving Forward:\n\nWe plan to put on 5 IRL conferences in 2023.

Community Pool Spend: Recover IBC tokens from Airdrop\n​\n## Author\n​\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n​\n## Motivation\n​\nEvmos’ [Rektdrop](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) pioneered a new model for distributing tokens. As announced on the [Evmos dashboard](https://app.evmos.org/mission-control), the Rektdrop ended on Block [5074187](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/5074187) (30 September 2022 at 16:06:40 UTC) and clawed back of all unclaimed tokens, returning them to the Evmos Community Pool.\n\nDuring this process, the [IBC module account](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x) was falsely targeted for clawback and transferred all EVMOS tokens from the IBC module account to the Evmos Community Pool. At the time of the clawback, this account held a balance of ~3.2 million EVMOS tokens (3167501226339726493675414aevmos). \n\nTo remediate this unexpected transfer of funds, we propose to return the funds from the Evmos Community Pool back to the IBC module account with this proposal. Note that we are simply withdrawing the amount from the Community Pool that could affect users and not the entire amount in the Community Pool.\n​\n## Impact\n​\nThe EVMOS tokens on the IBC module account represent the total amount of EVMOS tokens that have been sent to other chains over IBC. Users may currently be encountering an inability to transfer their EVMOS balances on these other chains back to Evmos. This is because there is an insufficient balance on the IBC module account. The Community Pool Spend outlined in this proposal would restore the balance on the IBC module account, enabling users to once again transfer up to their entire balance of EVMOS tokens from other Comsmos chains back to the Evmos chain via IBC.\n\nThe bug also falsely targeted some additional user accounts during the clawback. This means that some users' funds were accidentally clawed back to the Community Pool as well. We’ve moved quickly to identify the wallets affected and amounts that each are owed. We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \n\n## Requested amount\n\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\n\nBefore clawback:\n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\nbalances:\n- amount: \"3167501226339726493675414\"\n  denom: aevmos\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nAfter clawback: \n\n```bash\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\nbalances:\n- amount: \"100\"\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\n- amount: \"11000\"\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\n- amount: \"12274000\"\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\n- amount: \"12000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\n- amount: \"1000000\"\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\n- amount: \"2310000\"\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\n- amount: \"100000000000000000\"\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\npagination:\n  next_key: null\n  total: \"0\"\n```\n\nThe entire EVMOS balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \n\n## Learnings\n\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

We are currently planning an additional upgrade that returns these funds as well. \\n​\\n## Requested amount\\n​\\nThe requested amount to be returned to the IBC module account is determined by comparing the account balance one block before the clawback and after the block after the clawback.\\n​\\nBefore clawback:\\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074186\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"3167501226339726493675414\\\"\\n  denom: aevmos\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nAfer clawback: \\n​\\n```bash\\nevmos@evmostest:~/evmos8.2.0/bin$ ./evmosd q bank balances evmos1a53udazy8ayufvy0s434pfwjcedzqv345dnt3x --height 5074187\\nbalances:\\n- amount: \\\"100\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/25813B5DF7C0AF9FB79A71EF8E67FE4E182A03BB4145D248DADFAF74006835B2\\n- amount: \\\"11000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/5CC0E9B98B8C719E3378F941B40A4FAC9F750A155F3788E4C449144C08EA4537\\n- amount: \\\"12274000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/693989F95CF3279ADC113A6EF21B02A51EC054C95A9083F2E290126668149433\\n- amount: \\\"12000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/6B3FCE336C3465D3B72F7EFB4EB92FC521BC480FE9653F627A0BD0237DF213F3\\n- amount: \\\"1000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/7F0C2CB6E79CC36D29DA7592899F98E3BEFD2CF77A94340C317032A78812393D\\n- amount: \\\"2310000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/A4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701\\n- amount: \\\"100000000000000000\\\"\\n  denom: ibc/D8921A62D207159A25FFEA0DB4E7DB623A095219B60D99768CCE9D3DF66122C7\\npagination:\\n  next_key: null\\n  total: \\\"0\\\"\\n```\\n​\\nThe entire Emvos balance of 3167501226339726493675414aevmos was transferred to the community pool after the clawback. \\n​\\n## Learnings\\n​\\nThe Evmos team will publish a detailed post-mortem document to reflect on what led to this event and how it could have been prevented.

INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n\n**ChainHub & Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community and, post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\n\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is the faculty sponsor and founding faculty advisor of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\n\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n\n#### OUR EXPERIENCE\n\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\n\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately\n# 1\n two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n\n#### SUMMARY OF TERMS\n\n1. ChainHub will:\n  1. Incubate approximately two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n  2. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community ChainHub (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\n\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n\n#### BUDGET REQUEST\n\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\n\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\n1. The first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (285714 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (142857 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3. The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (142857 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 625K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 100K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 125K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\n\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 2 Web3 + backend engineers, 1 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe tokens will be staked and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. When exhausted, we will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 50K a month in conversion to USD.\n\nA multisig will be set up to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\n#### PROPOSED PROJECTS\n\n **EvLend**\n\nProject Specs: [https://sierra-fi.gitbook.io/evlend/](https://sierra-fi.gitbook.io/evlend/)\n\nEvLend aims to be the most efficient variable rate borrow-lend market on Evmos.\n\nEvLend uses reactive interest rate technology to target specific utilization rates (% of funds in the money market being borrowed) for stablecoin assets while still providing support for borrow & lend services to other assets.\n\nReactive interest rates are a more recent innovation popularized by Euler finance. EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.\n\nEvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.\n\nMore information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.\n\n**Evmos Bridge**\n\nProject Specs: [https://crest-protocol.gitbook.io/evmos-bridge-specs/](https://crest-protocol.gitbook.io/evmos-bridge-specs/)\n\nWe propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning. Additionally, we will build the cross-chain protocol leveraging a battle tested security and consensus model that is as secure as the economic security of the blockchains it is built upon.\n\nWith the minimal bridge paths available today, Evmos will continue to struggle with onboarding users and value into the ecosystem.\n\nProviding routes for users to bridge from the most popular DeFi hubs such as Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, among others, streamlines the process for users to onboard value into Evmos by orders of magnitude.\n\nFor more information regarding the specifications of the bridge please refer to the documentation or reach back out to us for any further questions.\n\n[1](#sdfootnote1anc) We say \"approximate\" as we may not converge on two projects, or may converge on more than two per year. Our goal will remain to incubate at least two per year.\n\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"discussion","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNiapmbkik4D4-OUzrO2yeQ_Ai2o3k8qeMZDgGN92NE/edit?usp=sharing","topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-29T03:17:22.885Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1cektycezre8fl468hfplmmu99eyzw4vqyj86we\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"ChainHub/Texas Blockchain Incubator\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"Incubating Projects for Evmos\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-09-26T02:21:59.751Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"###\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"# INCUBATION PROPOSAL\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"**ChainHub & Texas Blockchain Incubator**\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"**sriram@chainhub.net**\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"#### INTRODUCTION\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"code-block\\\":\\\"plain\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"This proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community.

all,\n\nThis is a follow up to Proposal 39 to introduce Evmos external incentives in Osmosis, Pool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO) . The original Commonwealth discussion can be found HERE .\n\nBackground\n\nWe have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M! The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th , so the community needs to decide the next steps forward!\n\n(image)\n\nQuestions\n\n#1) Does the community wish to extend the Osmosis External Incentives?\n\n#2) If so, how many tokens? For how many days?\n\nProposal\n\nUPDATE OCT 4th 2022\n\nBased on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, seems like the preferred path forward is another 600k EVMOS over 90 days . Osmosis is the gateway for new users into the Cosmos ecosystem so it is important to maintain deep liquidity. Once this period is over, we can reevaluate the incentives as we will have a clearer picture with how native liquidity has grown.\n\n600k EVMOS over a 90 day period (6,666.67 EVMOS per day), 100 EVMOS for funding Osmosis gauge creation and filling. (Updated Oct. 8th)\n\nTOTAL : 600,100 EVMOS\n\n14 day bond only\n\nPool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\n\nMULTISIG (3/4)\n\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\n\nbennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n\n@Tricky | Cosmos Spaces  - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nLPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nJohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs\n\nTimeline\n\nA proposal would need to be on-chain no later than October 10th and subsequently passed to allow for enough time to refill the gauge and have no disruption in external incentive rewards.\n\n-benny","kind":"discussion","stage":"Passed","url":null,"topic_id":1160,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":false,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-09-28T18:41:43.095Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos1u0qpyh04ufyyt6q0vqj7pjwk6k0j2mjm353zsj\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"benny lava\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/99601250-a20e-4a64-a2e0-c3af708abac9.jpg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-09-26T14:27:12.558Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"{\\\"ops\\\":[{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Hi all,\\\\n\\\\nThis is a follow up to \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/39\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Proposal 39\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\" to introduce Evmos external incentives in Osmosis, \\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"link\\\":\\\"https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/722\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"Pool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\".

GRANT PROPOSAL // PARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nOne Sentence Description: “Sequester-To-Earn” Platform that incentivizes climate action\n\nWebsite:  www.avatree.xyz\n\nTwitter/IG: @_avatree\n\nMISSION AND VISION\n\nAvatree is a “Sequester-To-Earn” platform where people are incentivized to take climate action.\n\nWe see climate change as a collective coordination problem. Since web3 has been incredibly effective at solving such problems, our vision is to adapt key learnings from web3 to onboard millions of people to the climate movement and accelerate carbon sequestration efforts worldwide.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe user purchases a subscription of carbon credits along with an Avatree NFT, which is a digital sapling. As the user makes their monthly payments to purchase carbon credits, the sapling grows algorithmically and fruits Avatree tokens. This token can be spent to personalize their Avatree NFT, attend IRL / online events and purchase brand rewards. Alternatively the user can trade their tokens on the open market for cash.\n\nBUSINESS MODEL\n\nWe earn money by:\n\n1. Charging for Avatree NFTs - $25-$100/each, 100% margin\n\n2. Monthly carbon credit subscription - $10-$100/month, 3.5% margin\n\n3. NFT Resale Revenue - 5% of resale\n\nTEAM\n\nChetan Nandakumar - CEO/Product:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/cnandakumar\n\n• 10+ years as PM and ML engineer at companies such as Recruitbot & Leap Motion\n\n• Co-founder of Modista.com - computer vision for apparel search\n\n• UC Berkeley PhD in AI & Neuroscience, NSF Graduate Fellow\n\nTyler Streeter - Graphics Engineer:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerstreeter/\n\n• Founder of iBonsai iOS app, 120K total downloads, 55K paid downloads\n\n• PhD in AI, MS in VR from Iowa State University\n\n• Portfolio: http://tyl.st/projects/\n\nAnusheel Bhushan - Full Stack Engineer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusheel/\n\n• Founder of Strive Labs.\n\n• Principal Engineer, eBay\n\n• BS IIT Delhi, MS UC Irvine\n\nChris Znerold - Design Lead:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/znerold/\n\n• Founder of Stay.Gold Design Firm: www.stay.gold\n\n• Design Lead at AirBnB, Apple Music & Disney Interactive\n\n• Creative Director at PlayStation\n\n• Portfolio:  http://znerold.com/\n\nADVISORS\n\nBradley Horowitz, VP Product at Google:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradleyhorowitz/\n\n• VP Product at Google\n\n• Former head of GMail, GCalendar, Google Voice, and many other Google teams\n\n• MIT Media Alum\n\nPhilip Taylor, Climate Scientist:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipgrahamtaylor/\n\n• Climate Fellow at UC Boulder\n\n• Founder Mad Agriculture - helping farmers turn their operations to being regenerative\n\n• PhD from UC Boulder in Climate Science\n\nPARTNERSHIP WITH REGEN NETWORK\n\nRegen Network is a blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem and a leading provider of carbon and ecological credits in the ReFi space. They will serve as a key partner with us, providing us with the carbon credits that power our platform, and promoting us to their community.\n\nHOW CAN WE BE SURE THESE CREDITS ARE REAL?\n\nThe carbon credit / ecological credit industry holds a lot of potential to support climate restoration, but it’s also a new, unregulated industry and ripe with abuse.\n\nWe take this issue seriously and are taking the following measures to ensure that the credits purchased through our platform contribute to tangible and meaningful climate action:\n\n1. We will only be selecting those credits that match the following criteria:\n\nNature based - restoring ecological habitats\n\nClear and proven additionality - a given habitat would not have been restored without additional funding\n\nMeasurable impact - can the activities to preserve or regenerate ecology be measured and confirmed? What are the downstream outcomes from this land preservation or restoration (ie. improvements in soil health, biodiversity, water quality, etc)\n\n2. Regen Network, our supplier for carbon credits, is a pioneer in this ReFi industry and is leading the way for high-end ecological credits and industry standards. Here’s are links to articles about some of their carbon credits:\n\nNCT, Nature Carbon Tonne:  https://medium.com/regen-network/introducing-nature-carbon-ton-nct-6d0fbaaf490d\n\nCarbonPlus Grasslands credits:  https://registry.regen.network/methodologies/carbonplus-grasslands\n\n3. Phil Taylor (see above), a leading climate scientist and entrepreneur, has joined our team as an advisor and will be guiding our carbon credit strategy\n\n4. Using web3 increases transparency around these credits. Each credit will be on-chain and labeled with its location, the person/agency who created the credit, the independent verifier, related images, etc.\n\nMARKET TRENDS\n\n• NFTs grew 23x from 2020 to 2021 into a $23B industry\n\n• The voluntary carbon market will grow 15x and will be worth upwards of $50B by 2030\n\n• There are 10+ consumer carbon offset products on the market, but none have garnered widespread adoption (see “Competition” section below)\n\nCORE ASSUMPTION\n\nOur core assumption is that there’s a massive untapped market of individuals who want to take climate action but just need a nudge to do so. We believe that nudge consists of social and financial incentives.\n\nCOMPETITION & UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nThere is a burgeoning demand for carbon offsetting products from consumers, and there are 10+ consumer-oriented carbon offsetting products on the market attempting to meet this need.\n\nSome of the key players in our space are Klima, Wren (YC and Union Square Ventures backed), Joro (Sequoia Backed), and Terrapass. All these products take a dry, individualized approach to carbon offsetting. They ask the user questions to assess their carbon footprint, and then allow them to offset it by purchasing a monthly subscription of carbon credits.\n\nAlthough these products have engaged hundreds of thousands of people, none of them have garnered widespread adoption, leaving open a massive market opportunity. The existing products have poor UX without any gamification or integrated social engagement. By creating a social, incentivized solution, Avatree aims to seize this market opportunity.\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nWe will grow our user base through web3 and web2 strategies such as community building through Discord / Twitter spaces / influencer engagement, and social media marketing.\n\nAlso, by addressing climate, a topic of growing global concern, we can leverage existing communities in the climate space. Since Avatree is a monetized platform, we can sign on these organizations as affiliates, so that they get paid when their members sign up for Avatree.\n\nTRACTION\n\nWe launched a preview of our algorithmic tree at  VERSE , an augmented reality art gallery in SF and Denver. Visitors experience the Avatree exhibit as a 16ft 3D hologram that grows from sapling to tree in 4 minutes. We're on display alongside top-end artists such as Android Jones and Zed Run and have become a \"crowd favorite\" of the gallery. Since February, VERSE has had 15K guests in SF and Denver and will be expanding to 15 locations around the world in 2022.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n- Accepted to the 2022 Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator, a non-dilutive accelerator, 6% acceptance rate\n\n- Accepted to the World Economic Forum's 2022 Crypto Impact and Sustainability Accelerator & Crypto Sustainability Coalition\n\nWORKING PROTOTYPE\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pde95ir1u4s24o3/avatree-video.mp4?dl=0\n\nDECK\n\nhttps://docsend.com/view/nvdvw6q4nyuqkvtp\n\nTECHNICAL ROADMAP\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mrwi491mpv522y1/Avatree%20Tech%20Roadmap.pdf?dl=0\n\nMILESTONES\n\nMilestone 1, Initial Kickoff, Nov 1, 2022\n\nMilestone 2, Dec 15, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm for single growing tree\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 1 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 3, Feb 1, 2022, $40k\n\n- Algorithmic tree: Create algorithm that can grow multiple trees\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 2 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\nMilestone 4, Mar 15, 2023, $20k\n\n- Smart Contract + Web App: Phase 3 (see “Technical Roadmap” for details)\n\n- Public Launch of Avatree Product to Potential Consumers\n\nTOTAL: $100k\n\nHEADCOUNT BREAKDOWN\n\nFull Stack Engineer, 16 weeks, Full-time, $45/hr, $28.8k\n\nBlockchain Engineer, 12 weeks, Full-time, $60/hr, $28.8k\n\nGraphics/AI Engineer, 8 weeks, Full-time, $70/hr, $20.6\n\nDesigner, 16 weeks, Quarter-time, $70/hr, $12k\n\nSmart Contract / Backend Testing and Revision - $10k\n\nBENEFIT TO EVMOS\n\nWhen we launch the platform (in March 2023) we anticipate selling 2k-5k NFTs. Pricing them at the lower end of the scale, this would translate to $50k-$125k in EVMOS tokens. Additionally, if each person purchases ~$10 in carbon credits per month, this translates to $20k - $50k in carbon credits purchased each month on COSMOS\n\nIn one year, we anticipate increasing our userbase to 10k-25k users. So this would translate to $250k-$625k in EVMOS tokens. And then more as we continue to grow the network in the next few years.\n\nFYI, an important distinction with our model is that there is no cap to the the number of NFTs we mint. The financial incentives for participation center around the token rewards generated by the NFTs. Our vision is for this to be a consumer product with hundreds of thousands of users in the years ahead\n\nFUTURE EXPANSION\n\nAfter the completion of this grant, Avatree will continue to expand its userbase and product offerings.

Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos software upgrade at block height [4,655,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/4655500) from it's current version [v7.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v7.0.0) to [v8.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\n\n\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\n\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade.

I'm opening up this thread on scheduling the next software upgrade on mainnet. Please find below an overview of the proposed changes and the motivation behind them. Please let us know what you think of the upgrade!\n\n## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at block height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a high level, the `v5.0.0` software includes the following improvements:\n\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with `erc20/` names to be sent over IBC\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the `MinGasPrice` and `MinGasMultiplier` fee market parameters\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\n\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\n\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with `erc20/`\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\n* Set the `MinGasPrice` param value to `25,000,000,000aevmos` (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\n\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\n\n## Testing\n\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5467-evmos-software-upgrade-v500).\n","kind":"discussion","stage":"Rejected","url":null,"topic_id":1474,"pinned":false,"chain":"evmos","read_only":true,"version_history":["{\"timestamp\":\"2022-06-15T09:17:12.625Z\",\"author\":\"{\\\"_judgements\\\":{},\\\"_isOnchain\\\":false,\\\"_isCouncillor\\\":false,\\\"_isValidator\\\":false,\\\"_isEmpty\\\":false,\\\"_isNameInvalid\\\":false,\\\"chain\\\":\\\"evmos\\\",\\\"address\\\":\\\"evmos10f07kayaz3tedg0wgltj8kwvct07p92n4d4hkp\\\",\\\"_initialized\\\":true,\\\"_name\\\":\\\"danburck\\\",\\\"_headline\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_bio\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"_avatarUrl\\\":\\\"https://commonwealth-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/83efe7e2-4a21-4c69-88d9-3401fe73cb7c.jpeg\\\",\\\"_lastActive\\\":\\\"2022-06-10T13:14:21.547Z\\\"}\",\"body\":\"## Author\\n\\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\\n\\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos mainnet software upgrade at bloc height [837,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/837500) (around 3pm UTC next Monday) from it's current version [v4.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to [v5.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

This can be seen and will be seen as arbitrary decision making based on haphazardness that could be boiled down to the mood of the people in charge of handling those delegations.\n\nSuggestion: A clear framework is necessary to protect everyone in the Evmos Ecosystem; understanding how and why things are the way they are benefits all actors involved.\n\nThere should be at least a simple and concise framework like Bitsong's delegation program ( https://github.com/bitsongofficial/delegation-program ) in place for everyone to understand how foundation delegations should be handled.\n\n2) The size of foundation delegations that are being handed out\n\nToday we saw delegations of 600k+ Evmos tokens distributed to a handful of select validators. 600k Evmos at this time is approximately worth 1.8 million dollars.

I am merely bringing to light that this sets a very dangerous precedent with no transparency at hand. Delegations of this size seem troubling to the nature of decentralization.\n\nSuggestion: I believe 600k Evmos per delegation is way too much without any proper framework, procedure, and protocol.

on Words and Concepts\n\nWords are a form of cached consensus between individuals/groups and the larger society.\n\nConsensus on words and concepts (since they serve as cache) should be next to

If they are neologisms, their lemma will be updated in governance texts according to (2) and (3) as soon as those sources get to contain the words or/and concepts.\n\nThe exact link between words and concepts is not required for each word of a gov proposal, but the links have to be resolved by the proposer for each and every challenge (in the off-chain proposal discussions) of the meaning of a word or punctuation sign that may substantially change the global meaning of any gov proposal.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Laurel Project Governance .

Once the proposal passes (i.e is Approved by governance), the ERC20 module uses a factory pattern to deploy an ERC20 token contract representation of the Cosmos (ATOM) Coin. More info regarding x/erc20 module [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/tree/main/x/erc20/spec)\n\n**3 main benefits for doing so:**\n1. users will be able to swap Evmos with ATOM on Evmos itself (giving ATOM access to DeFi protocols, NFT)\n2. build new applications that are based on ERC-20 smart contracts and have access to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n3. AAVE will be deployed on Evmos and ATOM is an initial supported asset [more here](https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-aave-v3-on-evmos/7149)\n\n\n**Recap**\n- We are primarily guided by the following naming convention [assetlist](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/assetlists/blob/main/osmosis-1/osmosis-1.assetlist.json#L50-L65)\n- We shouldn't specify a channel number to the symbol ```\n{NAME}\n``` on the first coin registration.

Once the proposal passes (i.e is Approved by governance), the ERC20 module uses a factory pattern to deploy an ERC20 token contract representation of the Cosmos (ATOM) Coin.

RegisterERC20 Proposal: USDC, wETH (Testnet)\n\n**Author:**\n\nConner Swann ([@yourbuddyconner](https://twitter.com/yourbuddyconner)), Nomad Core Team\n\n  \n\n**Context:**\n\nThe Nomad Team would like to start a discussion about the merits of whitelisting Nomad Assets for conversion to Native Cosmos coins. This proposal thread corresponds to two on-chain Testnet proposals: \n\n- RegisterERC20 (Goerli USDC): https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/31\n- RegisterERC20 (Goerli wETH): #TODO\n\n**About Nomad:**\n\n[**Nomad**](https://nomad.xyz) is building interoperability solutions for the cross-chain future. Leveraging an optimistic mechanism, the **Nomad Core** protocol facilitates message-passing between sovereign blockchains, and requires only one honest actor to prevent fraud.

thread aims at gauging community sentiment around pushing back the decay date for the Rektdrop so more users have time to claim their airdrop. Users have experienced barriers to claiming the airdrop that haven't all been fixed as we approach the beginning of decay, and we want to give every user a fair chance at claiming their portion of the Rektdrop.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe Rektdrop is set to begin decay on Sunday July 3, 2022 where users who have not claimed their tokens yet will begin to see a small percentage \" and start go be directed back towards the community pool. We are now less than 4 days from the start and there are still issues that are preventing users from claiming their full share of the Rektdrop.\n\nThe team has made the proper fixes for most of these issue in the upcoming upgrade on Monday July 4th, 2022, but the unclaimed airdrop amounts will begin to decay at no fault of the users even before this upgrade takes place.

These tokens will be reimbursed from the community pool at a later date after all the data is gathered and verified.\n\nWe fast track this proposal on chain if there are no concerns or red flags from the community to limit the amount of decay users experience and make step 2 simpler.\n\nThis will not only ensure users don't experience decay at no fault of their own, but also give more time for new users to claim this airdrop to promote healthy token distribution for Evmos.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe push back the Rektdropt decay date to begin on Monday August 1st, 2022 @ approximately 09:00 UTC. We signal agreement that any user who experienced decay before the newly set decay date should have those tokens reimbursed by the community pool at a later time after we gather the proper info and come up with the plan to send these funds back.\n\nConsidering the start of decay being less than the socially agreed 3 days for a commonwealth discussion, we may fast track this proposal on chain to limit the decay for users if there is no opposition from community members.\n\nI will update the thread with relevant information and decisions as the discussion matures and it is needed.

all,\n\nI want to start a discussion on enabling the inflation module on Evmos Mainnet.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted.\n\nAfter the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\nensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n\ngive more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling the inflation module would mean, that\n\nstaking rewards,\n\nusage incentives and\n\ncommunity pool allocation\n\nare enabled.\n\nTesting on Testnet\n\nWith proposal 28 the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\nstaking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n\ninteracting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts.

post is somewhat related to and goes some way towards addressing the concerns brought up in this post.\n\nAssuming an average 6.5s block time on mainnet (evmos_9001-2), active validators can get away with only signing half of the blocks in a ~54 hour window without being slashed. In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\n\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\n\nSignedBlocksWindow : change from \"30000\" to \"10000\".\n\nMinSignedPerWindow : change from \"0.500000000000000000\" to \"0.050000000000000000\"\n\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.

In my humble opinion, this is far too lenient and discourages validators in the active set from taking the proper precautions for ensuring maximum uptime and service continuity. These precautions include: setting up monitoring, beefing up hardware, exchanging tips with and seeking advice from other validators, etc. It also contributes to a less competitive validator landscape that ultimately jeopardizes the security of the network and allows inactive validators to linger in the safety of the top 50 validator slots.\\\\n\\\\nTo alleviate this, I recommend the following changes:\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"SignedBlocksWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"30000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"10000\\\\\\\".\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"bold\\\":true},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"MinSignedPerWindow\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\": change from \\\\\\\"0.500000000000000000\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"0.050000000000000000\\\\\\\"\\\"},{\\\"attributes\\\":{\\\"list\\\":\\\"bullet\\\"},\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\n\\\"},{\\\"insert\\\":\\\"\\\\nThis would effectively cut down on the number of blocks validators are allowed to miss in a specified window.
