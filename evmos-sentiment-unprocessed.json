It makes that process as simple and seamless as possible by allowing developers to continue creating apps in Solidity and Vyper like theyâ€™re accustomed to in the Ethereum ecosystem. Evmos opens a new frontier for blockchain applications, expanding the functionality of the EVM by enabling cross-chain applications that tap the liquidity and user bases of multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide more unified experiences."},"links":{"homepage":["http://evmos.org/","",""],"whitepaper":"","blockchain_site":["https://www.mintscan.io/evmos","https://evm.evmos.org/token/0xd4949664cd82660aae99bedc034a0dea8a0bd517","https://etherscan.io/token/0x93581991f68dbae1ea105233b67f7fa0d6bdee7b","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x93581991f68dbae1ea105233b67f7fa0d6bdee7b","https://evmos.explorers.guru/","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/evmos","",""],"announcement_url":["https://evmos.blog",""],"twitter_screen_name":"EvmosOrg","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"EvmosOrg","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/tharsis/evmos"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/thumb/evmos.png?1696523216","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/small/evmos.png?1696523216","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/large/evmos.png?1696523216"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":50.0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":50.0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":30570,"market_cap_rank":1231,"developer_data":{"forks":845,"stars":1658,"subscribers":189,"total_issues":0,"closed_issues":0,"pull_requests_merged":2108,"pull_request_contributors":108,"code_additions_deletions_4_weeks":{"additions":17733,"deletions":-19422},"commit_count_4_weeks":33,"last_4_weeks_commit_activity_series":[0,0,5,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,4,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0]},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2024-08-22T12:30:59.580Z"}
