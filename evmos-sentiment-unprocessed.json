It makes that process as simple and seamless as possible by allowing developers to continue creating apps in Solidity and Vyper like theyâ€™re accustomed to in the Ethereum ecosystem. Evmos opens a new frontier for blockchain applications, expanding the functionality of the EVM by enabling cross-chain applications that tap the liquidity and user bases of multiple blockchain ecosystems to provide more unified experiences."},"links":{"homepage":["http://evmos.org/","",""],"whitepaper":"","blockchain_site":["","","","","","","","","",""],"official_forum_url":["","",""],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/evmos","",""],"announcement_url":["https://evmos.blog",""],"twitter_screen_name":"EvmosOrg","facebook_username":"","bitcointalk_thread_identifier":null,"telegram_channel_identifier":"EvmosOrg","subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com","repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/tharsis/evmos"],"bitbucket":[]}},"image":{"thumb":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/thumb/evmos.png?1696523216","small":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/small/evmos.png?1696523216","large":"https://coin-images.coingecko.com/coins/images/24023/large/evmos.png?1696523216"},"country_origin":"","genesis_date":null,"sentiment_votes_up_percentage":60.0,"sentiment_votes_down_percentage":40.0,"watchlist_portfolio_users":30141,"market_cap_rank":1456,"developer_data":{"forks":857,"stars":1662,"subscribers":187,"total_issues":0,"closed_issues":0,"pull_requests_merged":2268,"pull_request_contributors":112,"code_additions_deletions_4_weeks":{"additions":121060,"deletions":-39271},"commit_count_4_weeks":41,"last_4_weeks_commit_activity_series":[]},"status_updates":[],"last_updated":"2024-12-01T20:19:16.051Z"}
