This will sponsor gas payments for end users when they perform actions like SWAP, STAKE and more on Diffusion. The only constraint is that these incentives have to be less than the fees. Incentives can be up to 120% the total amount of fees burned, so users can end up being paid to use Diffusion. Beware that users will still have to pay for the fees upfront but will get reimbursed each epoch (1 week by default), so they are accumulated and then reimbursed.",

This is a reasonable misunderstanding as the network query for this param mistakenly returns a value denominated in seconds, i.e. this query: `evmosd query claims params` previously resulted in a response of: `duration_until_decay: 3801600s`.\n\nThis proposal also serves as an early signal, should the community decide to conduct a coordinated upgrade prior to its full voting period.\n\nOriginal discussion of the proposal that led to this issue: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4744-extend-claims-period-by-21-days",

        "description": "## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Parameter being changed with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will enable the inflation module on Evmos by changing the `ParamStoreKeyEnableInflation` parameter from `false` to `true`. This propsal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted. After the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\n* ensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n* give more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\n## Impact\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully on-chain and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling this module activates\n\n* staking rewards,\n* usage incentives and\n* community pool allocation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4965-enable-inflation-module). For an in-depth explanation of the module, please refer to the [module specification](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/inflation/).\n\n## Testing on Testnet\n\nWith [proposal 28](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/28) the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\n* staking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n* interacting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts. The incentives pool fills up once a day through inflation\n* querying the community pool: a part of inflation is allocated in the community pool once a day. Query the community pool to make sure it's increasing according to the [Evmos Token Model](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b).\n\nNote, that the team allocation of the Evmos Token Model is not handled through inflation but instead was implemented with vesting accounts.",

        "description": "Full proposal (on IPFS): https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf7wwUCzPfBZLcmkv4UkbfVU4xA5SkyjvCxVcpc3jtq5z \n\nPrior commonwealth discussion (draft version): https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4926-1m-evmos-developer-incentive-program-proposal-from-web3scholarship-program\n\nProposal:\n* Web3Scholarship program, the Web3 funding \u0026 incuabtion vehicle, which is funded by Huobi Incubator and with members including Dorahacks, Dao Maker etc., is proposing a $1m hackathon like developer incentive program on Evmos\n* Web3Scholarhip program is chain agnostic and supporting ecosystem building including Avalanche, Dfinity etc. Web3Scholarship initiate collaborations driven by research, Evmos Included. We’re bullish on Evmos\n* The goal for the hackathon event is to support ecosystem building after launch at a critical market condition. Incentives include $500k grants, over $500k investment, at least $10m liquidity, express IDO/IEO listing and incubation/advisory support to winning teams deployed on Evmos\n* It is proposed to have a 50-50 split of grants between Evmos community \u0026 Web3scholarship and sponsors, where $250k worth of Evmos tokens are asked for as grants to winning teams. Venture funding and liquidity come from Web3scholarship.\n* What we ask from Evmos community: 125,000 Evmos tokens (assuming Evmos price of $2USD according to roughly last 14 day average price). The principle is to provide $250k worth of Evmos tokens, therefore the actual number of tokens distributed may depend on future price performance close to (average 30 day Evmos token price prior) initial prize distribution i.e. the winning team announcement date . If \u003e $2, no more tokens are needed and remaining undistributed tokens stay at Evmos community. If less, then vice versa applies(open to revision).\n* Prize tracks: Grand prize(80k), Defi/Infra/ Web3/Metaverse Track prize (100k*4), EVM Migration prize (20k)\n\n\n\nReasoning and Potential Impact:\n* After Evmos mainnet is live and network is stable, it creates good window for ecosystem building whereas currently there is only Evmos limited grant available for devs. \n* The goal is to incentivize growth of key pillars of DeFi, NFT and Infrastructure of Evmos ecosystem at early stage, and teams of high aptitude will see a tangible leap in terms of performance and adoption via incentives and incubation.\n* Web3Scholarship is diverse \u0026 strong to provide attractive incentives and valuable incubation. The event is likely to get momentum for the ecosystem and ahchieve network effect.\n\n\n\nDeliverables and Timeline:\nThe whole event will firstly take 1 month planning starting from now and 1 and half months for the actual event. Event period is planned to be from July 7 to August 22. During which, Evmos specific developer support such as AMA and tutorials will be offered. \n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n* Goals: It is expected to have over 1,000 developers signed in, over 60 submissions and produce 3-5 investable projects and 1-2 flagships.\n* Avoid rug: strict scrutiny; code review; criteria; penalty clause\n* Quality projects: selective criteria; dev turnout: referrals\n* Dev turnout: galvanizing 10+ communities including Devpost, Dorahacks\n* Community engagement: will utilize hack platform to involve community vote in the selection of winning teams. \n\nProtection clause: Penalty and protection clause to be made so event host \u0026 sponsor are entitled to reject or make conditional fund provision.\n\nDistribution transparency:\nTo ensure a proper and synchronized grant distribution from both Evmos and Web3Scholarship, gnosis safe will be established and used for offering grants.\n\nAt last, features industry wide collaboration \u0026 contribution, we hope to spur growth at this critical point of time by this event. Thanks for your time to read this proposal and we apppreciate your support.",

        "description": "Cryptech is a web3 software development team with experience building an Airdrop Calculator for the Neptune Finance team on the Terra blockchain.\n\nAn Airdrop Calculator is a helpful application and dev tool that makes it easy for project teams to provide individual wallets with an airdrop according to chosen parameters. Without an Airdrop Calculator, it is costly in time and network resources for each team to manually track delegations and design an airdrop algorithm. This saves on dev time and gets airdrops into the hands of the Evmos community faster!\n\nCryptech is proposing to build a calculator web app with features for project teams, data analysts and individuals. The web app allows teams and analysts to choose an airdrop  distribution style (quadratic distribution, time-weight, single snapshot, etc.) and export a json or csv file that illustrates each wallet’s delegations, and the airdrop share they are expecting to receive. Additionally, the app will allow individuals to head to the Airdrop Calculator web page to calculate their delegations and the time spent delegating.\n\nThis app will help project teams save time calculating airdrop shares and help individuals track their delegations. To build this web application and make it available to the Evmos community, the Cryptech team is seeking 19,500 EVMOS tokens (~45k USD based on 14-day price average) to fund the following line items:\n\n- Full-stack web developer\n- Cloud infrastructure engineer\n- UX and graphics design\n- Data logging services and indexing\n- Running a private archival node until a public node is available\n- Web hosting for the application\n\nFor the sake of community confidence, the tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet controlled by community members, where 40% of the allocation to be provided up front to begin work and the remaining 60% to be delivered when MVP is online to continue improvement.\n\nMore details on the proposal and community discussion can be found here: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5178-evmos-grant-airdrop-calculator-built-by-cryptech-developments-ltd",

        "description": "View the discussion and full proposal here: \n\n https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5320-grant-request-to-sponsor-evmos-public-rpc-by-pocket-network \n\n This proposal is seeking funding to sponsor daaps of the EVMOS community with Pocket Network RPC usage. Developers will be able to mint secure endpoints via https://www.portal.pokt.network/ and benefit from our dev rel support, and endpoint security features. Additionally, we will provide a public-exposed endpoint. ( There is one we are already contributing to at https://evmos-json-rpc.stakely.io/ ).\n\n Pocket Network is a decentralized RPC service that enables a permissionless network of independent node operators to be incentivized for running full nodes for blockchains supported by the network. Daaps pay for RPC throughput by staking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on RPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that is created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node runners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and strengthening the overall RPC service. \n\n This model reduces central points of failure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution, redundancy, and censorship resistance.  We currently support over 20 blockchain networks including many popular EVM protocols.  We have recently added support for Evmos EVM mainnet. For real-time network data visit: https://www.poktscan.com/ \n\n By sponsoring daap’s usage of Pocket RPC within the EVMOS community we are contributing to decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship resistance of the network.",

This means 23k tokens will go towards Frax / FXS pools\n\nFrax has signaled their desire to become a fully collateralized stablecoin native to the Evmos ecosystem. This would help reinforce that, and would unlock many great use-cases for Evmos.\n\nThe funds will be sent to a multi sig with myself and founders of the projects mentioned for a 5 of 7 multi sig with. The members on the multi sig are:\n*myself\n*kinesis\n*cronus\n*coslend\n*exswap\n*diffusion\n*saddle\nThe multisig address is evmos:`0x27319052224B1E0cb6C7250f4BD4EE0e3a76755f`\n\nThe multisig will distribute tokens to project founders in equally split amounts to be allocated as incentives for those that provide liquidity during the program’s duration of 3 months.\n\nThe grants are intended to be as inclusive as possible, while also remaining competitive to projects that have shown strong traction or been very active participants in the Evmos ecosystem. With that said, there will be additional grant proposals like this to consider future projects that were not included in this initial proposal.",

The rewards would be distributed over the course of 90 days for 14 day bonding time only. This would amount to 5555.56 per day in external rewards.\n\nThe funds will be managed by a multisig wallet at the address below, and includes the following members:\n\nAddress:\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\nevmos1htlz4cyuvg2xyqeth3lun9a238yhsp3emvs8ud\n\n- bennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n- Tricky - Cosmos Spaces / Evmos Governance Workstream\n- LPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n- JohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs\n\nWeighted 3/4\n\nGoals\nExternal incentives in Osmosis, [pool 722](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/722) would help deepen Evmos liquidity on Osmosis resulting in lower slippage and stronger TVL. It would also support new user adoption by making the Evmos pool a desirable location to earn yield for Osmosis community members who have not interacted with Evmos yet. Externally rewarded pools in Osmosis boosts OSMO incentives as well. Based on the current high swap returns, Osmosis would be matching these external incentives 1:1 with OSMO rewards See Osmosis [proposal 264](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/264). Lastly, the external incentives will be issued daily in the form of the Evmos token to those bonded in the liquidity pool. This new liquidity will allow Osmosis users to explore the Evmos ecosystem by checking out Evmos EVM applications or help secure the network via staking.\n\nYou can find the community discussion [here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6040-ideation-osmosis-external-incentives)",

        "description": "**Who We Are:**\n\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder \u0026 CEO of Dystopia Labs (http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we've hosted 449+ workshops and 15 summits with reach in 18+ countries. With over 28,000+ registrants for our events, we've built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, \u0026 more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\n\n**Why Our Proposal Matters:**\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there's a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n- Dystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming two events: Hacksummit SF (a 2 day summit right before Stanford Blockchain Conference) and DeFi Bogota (a 1 day summit right before Devcon).\n- We are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $30k. This will help cover venue costs, AV support, furniture, and food.\n- We expect 300-350 ppl per event. And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we'd love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\n- To us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\n- In the past, we've had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot's team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\n- Other sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n\n**We're Part Of The Ecosystem:**\n\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor through events.\n-------------- \nNotes added by governance:\n\n- At the time of writing, Evmos is around $2.15. $30K is roughly 13,954 EVMOS when rounded up.\n- Proposal has gone through the recommended guidelines.

        "description": "This is a long, detailed proposal with markdown tables which may not render properly - **additionally, the proposal exceeded the max length, so a large portion has been excluded.** Please view the proposal on your browser if you wish to view it in its entirety, [on IPFS.](https://bafybeigcppwlvbrm6dwfaphflizaebvbpbkdkwqndlhublgdaq6xiry7py.ipfs.dweb.link/Evmos%20Sponsorship%20of%20HackAtom%202022%20Seoul%20and%20Participation%20in%20Korea%20Blockchain%20Week.html) The original Commonwealth thread can also be viewed [here.](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6083-prevote-draft-evmos-sponsorship-of-hackatom-2022-seoul-and-participation-in-korea-blockchain-week) \n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis proposal will provide the funding necessary needed for the sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th, followed by the participation in ETH Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week which ends on 14th of August. The HackAtom hackathon will also kick off the first of many events planned for [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders), a developer onboarding and network growth initiative.\n\n---\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nHackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.\n\nEvmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554)\n\n---\n\n ## **The Event** \n\n**Announcing Cosmos’s HackATOM Seoul**\n\nHackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. The full announcement [can be read here](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7).\n\n**Participating IBC Frens:**\n\n* Cosmos Hub, Interchain Foundation, Cosmostation, Osmosis, Crescent, Juno, plus more (check announcement).\n\n**Date**: July 29-31\n**Location**: Hanwha Dreamplus, Seoul\n\n---\n\n ## **Community Funding Request** \n\nThe requested amount as it stands is $168K, with the bulk of it going towards hackathon prizes and developer outreach. $50K allocated for marketing and PR will come from the waived sponsorship fee from Interchain Foundation.\n\n **A. Sponsorship Fees**\n\nPlatinum Sponsorship Package (Fee Waived) Includes:\n\n* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 \n* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet \n* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor \n* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022\n\n### **B. Hackathon Prizes**\n\nThe prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). \n\n[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)\n\nThe final hackathon tracks will be discussed and determined with the core dev team as well as with consultation from evmos4volunteers.\n\n### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**\n\nThe numbers that I am providing are currently derived as best estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019 blockchain gaming, and a dozen smaller meetups. \n\n**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. \n\nRight off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. However, we will aim for the lower-end of the range while leveraging the existing network of IBC frens.\n\nI will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. \n\n**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. \n\nFrom start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. \n\n**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. After speaking with Interchain Foundation and the HackAtom organizers, booth design will not require a significant budget.\n\nAround $2K will be allocated for Evmos merch / swag.\n\n### **D. Airfare + Accomodations + Miscellaneous Expenses**\n\nFor those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. \n\nAt the moment airfare to Korea from the States as well as Europe are well over $2K. Assuming that four Evmos representaives will in attendance, the cost for airfare should exceed just over $10K. Prices will likely fluctuate between now and then. Accomodation for housing is showing anywhere from $4K to $6K for the time periods of the events.\n\nLoredana from evmos4volunteers has been requested to attend to assist with technical discussions, which the community seems to be overwhelming in favor for. We are waiting for a final confirmation from loredana.\n\n## **Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability** \n\n1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. \n2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.\n3. $20K of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while $20K will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. \n4. The hackathon prize pool will also be sent to a multi-sig wallet and distributed post-event.\n5. I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure.\n\n## **Time Constraints** \n\nJuly 29th is fast approaching. I will continue to be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, blockchain incubators and communities, and everyone in between.\n\n## **Other Considerations** \n\nWe have decided not to sponsor KBW directly, but have confirmed with KBW organizers that whatever side event we decide to host, they will include it in their official list of events, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, and return the remaining funds to the community pool.\n\n## Multisig Signatories\n\n3 out of 5 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:\n- LPX (myself, who will be coordinating much of logistics here in Seoul)\n- Three team members / volunteer in attendance (Adonis, Tricky, and Loredana if she is able to make it)\n- One team member not present in Korea.\n\n---\n\nReference Links:\n\n* [HackAtom Seoul 2022 Event Page](https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022) \n* [Cosmos Signaling Proposal](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-signaling-proposal-hackatom-seoul-2022/6799?u=catdotfish) \n* [Official Cosmos Announcement](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7) \n* [HackAtom Official Site](https://hackatom.org/)\n* [ETH Seoul 2022](https://2022.ethseoul.org/)\n* [Blockchain Week Korea 2022](https://koreablockchainweek.com/)\n* [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders)\n\nA huge thank you to [@catdotfish](https://twitter.com/catdotfish) from Interchain and Erica from KryptoSeoul for the help in organizing this proposal.",

        "description": "# Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos\n\nFull discussion:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6454-judge-me-sponsor-a-volunteer-researcher-for-evminterchain-lobby-for-evmos\n\n**Loredana's (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project) proposal for Evmos:**\n\"Continue my volunteer work on EVM Inter-Chain, by formalizing the protocols, creating new inter-chain standards (like we started with IC_ERC20, IC_ERC721), extending nBridge for CosmWasm (EVM -- CosmWasm nBridge).\nFor this work to have a chance of adoption, I need to be close to Evmos, Cosmos, Interchain Foundation \u0026 other Cosmos blockchain teams. And the best location for me to influence the future tech for the benefit of the Evmos blockchain is Berlin. I would personally like to continue my work remotely and transparently (e.g. github, videos), but I found that it is very hard for other people to collaborate without face-to-face meetings.\n**The Evmos community would only sponsor my rent in Berlin (apartment + office), effectively sponsoring my lobby services, for the benefit of Evmos. My tech effort will remain a volunteer contribution, unpaid.**\n\n## Why should Evmos sponsor lobbying?\nBecause a multi-chain standard (like I am proposing) requires a controller chain to have a correct state view. This controller chain can be Evmos. See my 2 HackATOM videos: https://youtu.be/j5CVliOb-Ck and https://youtu.be/Khqv-1TbsMo .\n\"\n\nIn Berlin, Loredana would be available for technical conferences for the benefit of Evmos.\n\n## Why is Loredana Cirstea the best person for the job?\n* previous volunteering efforts for Evmos: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos\n* has live the only cutting edge chains where you can test inter-chain and multi-chain EVM transactions: https://github.com/the-laurel/demos\n* HackAtom Seoul participation: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md\n* https://loredanacirstea.medium.com/nbridge-inter-chain-erc20-and-how-to-not-get-rekt-by-bridges-unique-assets-shared-security-43f728f05552\n* has done many prototypes and demos demonstrating innovations on Evmos, some live on Mythos.\n\n## Expenses estimate:\n- office: https://www.fullnode.berlin/membership/, FIXED DESK, everyday. 490 € / month.\n- rent: ~2500 € / month (finding an apartment for less than 1 year is more costly; account for EVMOS price instability)\n- TOTAL: 2000 EVMOS / month. Any remaining money can be used for tech or diplomatic purposes (conference expenses, coffee meetings with tech influencers)\n- expenses and output will be tracked transparently [at this link](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md), as [was done for HackAtom](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md#expenses)\n\n## Deliverables:\n- at the end of each month, a detailed list of output [will be on GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md)\n- for the first 3 weeks the EVM Inter-Chain standards for the most popular EVM standards will be penned\n\n## Timeline:\n- sponsorship is paid 3 months in advance, every three months until the Evmos community decides to stop it.\n- this proposal is only made for 6 months (12000 EVMOS), to give the community a chance to re-vote based on output.\n\n## Multisig Signatories\n2 out of 3 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:\n- Tricky | Cosmos Spaces \n- Outcast | Legion Nodes\n- LPX \n\n## Abstain\nThe evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers validators will vote Abstain on this proposal.\n",

        "title": "The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO",
        "description": "**Summary:** The Governance workstream is asking the community for a formal awknowledgement and ratification of Evmos DAO's Interim Constitution through this vote.\n\n**Background:** The Governance workstream, with the blessing from the core team, has been working for several months researching case-studies, idealogies and philosophies in decentralized orgs, and all the various governance frameworks and styles of long standing DAOs — all for the eventual launch of Evmos DAO.\n\nIn the best interest of the community and the growth of the Evmos ecosystem, we have decided to move forward with an Interim Constitution to allow the Governance workstream to begin rolling out our governance framework in a modular basis, ultimately allowing for the creation of workstreams and special growth initiatives. The ratification of the Interim Constitution can be seen as the first of many steps in the formation of Evmos DAO.\n\nThis Interim Constitution has been in ideation and discussion for over a month, including [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6082-final-rfc-the-evmos-constitution), The Evmos Validator Fairness Initiative group, and multiple weekly governance calls.\n\n---\n\n# The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO\n\n## Preamble: The Declaration\n\nWe, the Evmos Community, formally declare our shared beliefs and mission to build and assist in growing the Evmos network. We strive to be the leading EVM network in the Cosmos Ecosystem, utilizing the Cosmos SDK modules, Tendermint's consensus engine, and the Inter Blockchain Protocol for a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, interoperable chain. The Evmos network, our community, and our governance processes must strive to play a role in laying the foundation for a more equitable, hyper-connected, decentralized future.\n\n## 1. The Evmos Community\n\nThe Evmos Community (\"community\") is a general all-encompassing term that comprises various groups that are participants in the Evmos network. The level and degree of participation may vary by group, but the common denominator of all members of the community should be the shared interest in the continued growth of the Evmos network.\n\n**1. Protocol Developers** - this group of developers focuses mainly on improving the Evmos network on the protocol level; this group includes core developers as well as individual contributors not considered as core team members.\n\n**2. Network Validators** - network validators are key members of the community responsible for securing the network through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n**3. Network Delegators** - network delegators are the predominant group that assist in network consensus and security by delegating power to validators through the staking of tokens.\n\n**4. Workstream and Committee Members** - workstream and committee members are those that work to improve and grow the Evmos network on a non-protocol level.\n\n**5. Community Leaders** - workstreams and special projects, although not required, may have an appointed leader to steward and lead his or her group.\n\n**6. Application Developers and End Users** - application developers and end users are those that develop, deploy, utilize, interact, transact, and ultimately bring value to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nWhile the aforementioned groups make up the majority of the community, the definition and composition of the community are not strictly limited to these groups.\n\n## 2. The Evmos Governance Framework\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework (\"framework\") is the foundational set of guidelines and processes developed for the community and network contributors to follow and flourish. The framework should be designed to recognize and incentivize contributors and curate a culture that creates long-term, positive-sum interactions between all community members and the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nThe framework is to be proposed and adopted separately from the Constitution. The Constitution shall take priority over the Governance Framework and should be regarded as the supreme guiding document.\n\n## 3. Guiding Principles\n\n**1. Progressive Decentralization:** The Evmos network aims to be as decentralized as possible, in the context of network validation as well as governance and finances. While network resiliency and the decentralization of power is paramount, we recognize the need to proceed with strategic and scientific-based planning. The community must not haphazardly rush into decisions that may potentially destabilize the chain or provoke a strong negative community reaction. The community will take the stance of progressive decentralization as we research and analyze the social, legal, and/or financial ramifications our decisions may potential have.\n\n**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship:** We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define \"favor\" as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with our mission and goals. We define \"disfavor\" as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos’ mission and goals.\n\n**3. User-Centrism:** Evmos is specialized to provide a unique EVM experience in the Cosmos ecosystem. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) user adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to steady growth: network liquidity, improvement of user experience, data sovereignty, stable production of blocks, educational resources, strong governance, etc.\n\n**4. Agnosticism:** Evmos should maintain neutrality as a chain with roots in both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. While the governance of Evmos may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the Evmos community should retain a stance of neutrality. Community members must leave tribalism at the door; we should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Evmos network.\n\n**5. Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Evmos is a network with a long history in the decentralization movement, with inspirations, ideas, protocols, and allies in various networks. Our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. Cross-chain collaborations, outreach initiatives, diplomacy missions, and continued participation in events are highly encouraged — especially with chains from the EVM and IBC ecosystems.\n\n**6. Consensual Collaboration:** While the Cosmos SDK’s implementation of governance is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work or compensation. Proposals will be assessed by the community on their merits alone and eventually voted on. In addition, proposals must follow the Governance Framework of the Evmos network and adhere to the principles outlined in the Constitution.\n\n**7. Sovereignty to Work:** The purpose of the Governance Framework is not to micro-manage proposals or teams. Sovereignty will be given to those that are working in accordance with the original proposal passed by the community, and are not in violation of any governance processes or principles of the Constitution.\n\n## 4. Removal of Community Leaders\n\nAll community members appointed to a role of higher responsibility, including workstream members, may be removed via a formal vote on-chain. The Governance Framework shall outline the appointment, removal, and appeals process, along with a detailed dispute resolution guideline.\n\n## 5. Constitutional Rights\n\nThe Governance workstream shall amend a Bill of Rights to the Constitution as soon as a general consensus can be confidently reached.\n\n## 6. Constitutional Amendments and Revisions\n\nThe community holds the power to propose an amendment to the Constitution by following the standard Evmos Proposal Lifecycle. The reasoning for the amendment must be justified and petitioned. If possible, there should be an attempt made to resolve the issue before a proposal for amendment is initiated.\n\n---\n\n**Validator/Community Code of Conduct and Constitutional Rights**\n\nWe recognize that this Constitution is missing a few key topics — however, we also see the need to tread carefully in these sensitive and controversial topics. While it is inarguable that these are necessary components of the Constitution, there was clear signaling that we needed more time to allow for the natural growth of the community before we could formally ratify some sections with confidence. We pledge to continue our research and continue to engage with the community to find general consensus on the best step forward. While some topics will be amended into the Constitution when they are ready, most will likely be implemented through the Governance Framework.\n\n---\n\n# Your Votes... \n\n**By voting YES**, you are signing the Constitution to be ratified so that the Governance workstream can shift focus and begin introducing components of the the Governance Framework that will allow for the creation of more  workstreams and special growth projects / committees / teams. Voting YES does not necessarily mean that you are fully content — but you will allow it.\n\n**By voting ABSTAIN**, you are signaling that you did not read the Constitution or do not understand its content or its purpose.\n\n**By voting NO**, you refuse to accept the Constitution at its current state.\n\n**By voting NO WITH VETO**, you are showing complete opposition to the Constitution and would rather leave the community than to have it ratified at its current state."

        "description": "Full discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6662-ideation-fund-dia-randomness-orcale-gas-fees-for-1-year \n Hi All, \n 0xCtrlAltApe here from the Orbital Apes team. I am starting this discussion to help launch DIA Randomness Oracles on Evmos. I am not affiliated with the DIA team in anyway.\n DIA provides an on-chain randomness oracle solution for EVM chains. If deployed the randomness oracle can be used by any smart contract on Evmos. While the DIA team does not charge for oracle usage, they do ask that gas fees to maintain the oracle are provided to launch on a new chain. By the DIA teams estimations this would be roughly 44 evmos/day which equals to 16060 Evmos for the year.\n Randomness oracles will allow for more innovative and new types of applications to be built on Evmos. Currently there are no options available for randomness on-chain on Evmos. As this oracle can be used for free by any dev/team on Evmos after deployment I believe that covering gas fees is an appropriate use of community funds.\n Funds will be sent to a (2/3) multisig managed by:\n 0xCtrlAltApe (Orbital Apes team member)\n Liam (Evmos team member)\n Samuel Brack (DIA team member)\n These funds can be sent to the DIA team on a monthly basis to cover gas costs for the randomness oracle. The fees earned from the fee-spilt module in Evmos v8 will be used to continue funding the oracle gas fees.",

        "description": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is the second iteration of the original proposal posted on Commonwealth on the 19th of July.  We are seeking community funding for our previous work as well as future efforts in indexing the Evmos network for the Covalent Unified API, along with the launch of the Evmos-Covalent Joint *#OneMillionWallets* Hackathon\n\n - **Covalent will continue to index the Evmos network and receive a compensation of 100K USD, which will be staked entirely and delegated to lower validators.**\n - **Covalent will run a joint hackathon with Evmos to onboard more developers, and explore and kickstart novel use cases for the Evmos ecosystem with a prize pool of $100K.**\n - **The total ask is $200K in Evmos tokens - The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.** \n\n\nNote: Because of the character limit of Cosmos SDK's governance module, some portions of the proposal have been left out and the proposal has been modified for on-chain submission with the help of the Evmos DAO Governance Workstream. View the full proposal on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). \n\n## Background\n\nAt Covalent, we believe blockchain technologies can change the world, but this potential is left unfulfilled if the data is not accessible. Despite the proliferation of on-chain digital assets, current solutions require developers to spend hours writing additional code to query granular blockchain data.\n\nCovalent is the only multi-chain API that provides every single point of on-chain data - directly from the browser. With no extra code, you need just one API call to query any piece of data across +40 blockchains.\n\n - +40 blockchains indexed, including  Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Evmos, Fantom, Harmony, Ronin, Moonbeam \u0026 Polygon\n - +30K developers, and\n - +3K live projects, including 0x, Aave, CoinGecko, ConsenSys, DappRadar, NFTX, ParaSwap, Sovryn, Uniswap, XDEFI Wallet \u0026 Zerion\n - +2.5M calls made to Evmos using Covalent's Unified API\n\n**Evmos API Call Volume Growth (Month over Month)**\n\n- June 2022 -- 2M / +312%\n - May 2022 -- 500K / +170,489%\n - April 2022 -- 282 / +14,000%\n - March 2022 -- 2\n\nCovalent's vision is to empower the pioneers of tomorrow by providing the most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem, delivering complete transparency and visibility to all on-chain digital assets.\n\n## API Endpoints for Evmos\n\n- Class A endpoints - These return enriched blockchain data applicable to all blockchain networks\n - Class B endpoints - These are for a specific protocol on a blockchain\n - Class C endpoints - This will be a community-driven market where users can create API endpoints for their projects\n - DEX \u0026 NFT marketplace data (i.e., EvmoSwap, Diffusion) \u0026 more to be integrated as the number of protocols grow. \n - Covalent will be indexing the entirety of Evmos' on-chain data\n\nMore details about our API can be found in [Evmos | Covalent Docs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/evmos/) \n\n## Timeline\n\n**The indexing of Evmos has already been completed and the completion was publicly announced on 30 May 2022. The indexing of Evmos is currently live, and freely available for developers.**\n\n- 30 May - 15 August 2022 -- A proposal to index Evmos is floated in the Evmos governance forum.\n - 22 September 2022 -- The joint hackathon registration goes live.\n - 22 October 2022 -- The Joint '#OneMillionWallets' Hackathon begins.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nPre-integration and Post-integration deliverables can be viewed in the [full proposal here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). \n\n## Funding \u0026 Disbursement\n\nThe EVMOS/USD exchange rate for the disbursements is to be determined according to the exchange rate at which the disbursements are made. \n\n- API and Indexing: 100K USD of Evmos  tokens will be released upon the passing of the proposal. **Covalent will stake the compensation and delegate it to lower validators** for up to one year. \n - #OneMillionWallets Hackathon: Roughly $100K in Evmos will be used to host the joint hackathon. \n\n The funds will be released initially to a 3 of 4-person multisig wallet with the following signatories: \n - Leibing, Dev Relations @ Covalent \n - Daniel, Data Journalist @ Covalent \n - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance \n - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO \u0026 Community Mod\n\n**Multisig deployment address:** 0x05a6991caD6B2258Bc5c7FE2b0793Af93590DbD0\n\nCovalent has an impressive track record of successful hackathons for Layer-1 networks. Past outcomes, marketing plans, and Evmos bounty tracks can be read in detail in the [full proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon).",

        "description": "## INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n**ChainHub \u0026 Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n# INTRODUCTION\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to Pittsburg, PA and other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community, and post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is one of the founders of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n# OUR EXPERIENCE\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: The Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n# SUMMARY OF TERMS\n1. ChainHub will:\n1. Incubate approximately two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n2. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community ChainHub (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n# BUDGET REQUEST\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\nThe first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (206611 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3.The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M).\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 700K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 75K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 75K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 3 Web3 + backend engineers, 2 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe tokens will be staked and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. When exhausted, we will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 30K a month in conversion to USD.\nA multisig will be setup to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\nLink to commonwealth discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6822-incubation-proposal-chainhubtexas-blockchain-projects-for-evmos](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6822-incubation-proposal-chainhubtexas-blockchain-projects-for-evmos)",

Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\\n\\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\\n\\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6653-evmos-software-upgrade-v810).",

It is the de-facto way to have EVM-powered Cosmos chains.\n- Ethermint's is developed and maintained by Tharsis \u0026 other contributors \u0026 volunteers.\n- [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is \"One Network. Two Chains. Ethereum and Cosmos.\"\n- Kava is today valued at ~$400M market cap\n- Estimated total value locked: ~$140M\n- Initial investment in building and marketing Kava is less than $1M\n- \"Kava Rise Program: $750M Developer Incentive Program. The structure of the Rise program will focus primarily on driving adoption and growth for the new Ethereum Co-Chain.\"\n- Kava Community Pool has ~80M KAVA tokens\n- Kava uses Ethermint for their Ethereum Co-Chain and Cosmos SDK for Cosmos in [their code](https://github.com/Kava-Labs)\n- Tharsis made [this Commonwealth proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6684-external-evm-infrastructure-funding-proposal-on-kava) to the Evmos and Kava communities, \"requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (3.7%) from the Kava Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R\u0026D team for 1 year.\", followed by opening a [Kava Community Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/). Resulting in the formal [on-chain Kava proposal #96](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/96)\n- Proposal #96 was rejected. 13/21 of the top validators votes YES, 1/21 voted ABSTAIN, and 7/21 did not vote. The top 21 validators have 88.90% voting power. Kava's co-founder \u0026 CEO's [response](https://twitter.com/Scott_Stuart_/status/1563228443436728321).\n- Kava Labs made its own \"Kava Infrastructure Security rewards\" [proposal #97](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/97), with no mention of funding Ethermint, as critical infrastructure. With no link to any Kava Community discussion. This proposal passed.\n- \"The Kava DAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Kava Network. Made up of the Kava stakers and validators that help to secure and run the network\"\n- Kava did not make any concrete offers to reward past development efforts for Ethermint\n\n## Why the Evmos Community has standing?\n\n- Evmos uses Ethermint as core infrastructure\n- Tharsis has most funds from the $EVMOS coin growth, so the Evmos chain became the de-facto treasurer for Tharsis\n- The Evmos Community are the guardians of Evmos interests, which include Ethermint and the well-being of Tharsis devs\n\n## Inter-Chain Diplomacy\n\nRight now, Ethermint tech is an exportable product from the Evmos chain to all other chains that do not make development effort towards it (but use it), therefore the payment should be in $EVMOS.\n\nThe Evmos community now has the standing to make a funding proposal in the name of Tharsis, in $EVMOS, first on the Evmos governance, then on Kava.\n\nGiven that the Kava Community rejected the request for funding Ethermint's future development, for 1 year, we propose that another funding request should be made to Kava by the Evmos Community, for past development efforts, that have already taken place and have already brought value to Kava. Any other future funding requests will be discussed separately.\n\nOff-chain polls \u0026 discussion for price discovery were opened in [Evmos Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote).\n\n## What will Kava stand to gain?\n\nEthermint will enter the most technically interesting phase: custom precompiles and EVM-Inter-Chain. Working prototypes already exist and were presented https://youtu.be/x75UobIr4qo?t=14670 and the ground work for Ethermint was set with https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272.\n\n(proposal lead:) I have personally developed the Go groundwork for inter-chain cooperation and deployed three public technical blockchains with EVM-Cosmos (Mythos, Ethos, and Logos), for demoing the inter-chain tech and I will re-base my work on the Ethermint extensibility of EVM precompiles.\nSome precompiles that I created that are pertinent to this:\n- abstract accounts (implementing account abstraction for EVM https://hackmd.io/@matt/r1neQ_B38)\n- quasar: ability to run Cosmos transactions from EVM\n- IBC precompile for EVM\n- nBridge: n-way (n\u003e=2) generalized bridge by transaction replay\n(Demos at: https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos)\n\nNext generation protocols are inter-chain. If Kava rewards past Ethermint development efforts, and demonstrates will to collaborate, it has a chance to be invited to benefit from the EVM-Inter-Chain innovations. This is no longer Ethermint, it is next-generation Ethermint (with extensions) and licensing may be subjected to change if context requires it.\nWe hope the Kava Community will not choose the short-term frugality over long-term greater benefits. Especially that this is an ethical opportunity that benefits Kava as image, Evmos, and the whole Cosmos.\n\n\n## Why should the Cosmos Community care?\n\n1. Blockchains are entities with communities. So, we need to have rules for behaving between chains. The proposal is bringing clarity to what is civil between chains (in this case, pertaining to funding previous dev efforts). Rejecting a proposal from Tharsis is different than rejecting a proposal from the Evmos Community. Kava and Evmos are part of the larger Cosmos Inter-Chain ecosystem.\n2. This proposal's purpose is to find a general way to determine a fair ask for any other chains, not only Kava.\n3. Ethermint is a core piece of infrastructure that brings value to Cosmos. The Cosmos Community should fight to keep it open-source and well-developed.\n4. Fairly rewarding effort made to evolve Cosmos is critical to inter-chain cooperation.\n5. Upholding the values of decentralized governance in each chain is a critical requirement for any inter-chain cooperation.\n\n\n## Votes\n\nIf you vote YES: This proposal will be posted on Kava's subreddit, for Kava Community feedback. And then, as an on-chain proposal to the Kava Community.\n\n\n## Proposal Lead\n\nThis proposal was led on behalf of the Evmos Community, by Loredana Cirstea - elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office (Evmos Governance proposal #45) and a volunteer from The Laurel Project (https://evolve.provable.dev/). This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).\n"

        "title": "Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program",
        "description": "## Summary \n\nThis proposal, also known as [\"Kickstart DeFi on Evmos\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos) from Commonwealth, will begin the Evmos DAO Liquidity Incentives Program with the bootstrapping of liquidity pools on the Diffusion DEX. More initiatives are in the works with other DeFi projects, and will be proposed when ready.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. We have also had very attractive staking APR that gave a higher return than most liquidity pools, and a bridge exploit that destroyed the TVL of Evmos DeFi in a matter of hours.\n\nDespite the hurdles, we are confident in saying that we had great success with our incentivization initiative for the EVMOS/OSMO pool through Prop 39 which provided 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days on the Osmosis DEX. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis in nearly all areas including TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 5th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $9.8M and one of the highest volume pools of over $3M. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring soon, and while we do plan on extending the Osmosis program, we must also begin looking inward: our native TVL.\n\n## Strategy \n\nAs more EVMOS tokens are staked, the APR rates have been decreasing at an accelerated rate. Millions of tokens are being unbonded at this moment, and without alternative pools with very appealing rates, they will most likely be going to Osmosis to be sold. Our first priority is to 1) build the much needed liquidity to wean off our reliance on Osmosis pools for liquid markets; 2) attract fellow IBC friends to participate in our high rewards programs and attract the unbonding Evmos tokens to find its way into these incentivized pools.\n\nThe Community Treasury is currently sitting around 33mil EVMOS tokens with 75mil+ EVMOS tokens returning from the unclaimed airdrops, and with an usage incentives escrow wallet which is now nearing 35mil tokens.\n\nIn total, roughly 143mil EVMOS (~$357mil @ $2.5), is left sitting with no benefits, when they can be put to strategic use that not only encourages more network participants, but also brings the community rewards for helping with the bootstrap initiative.\n\nIn summary, this is an aggressive but needed first step in further growing the Evmos network. Liam from Evmos explains eloquently in [this comment](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos?comment=30063) why this proposal is so important. We highly suggest reading the comment for context.\n\n ## Plan of Action \n\nDiffusion will be the first DEX to receive incentives, as they have been the leading DEX prior to the Nomad exploit. More protocols and DeFi projects will follow, with programs of their own.\n\nDiffusion will continue with their DIFF rewards for existing pools, resulting in *double rewards* for the pools that will be incentivized further with Evmos tokens.\n\n2mil EVMOS tokens will be released into a Gnosis Safe (3/5 signatures). Over the course of 90 days, the allocated EVMOS rewards will be released into Diffusion's staking contract (MiniChefv2 \u0026 Audited). We are initially aiming to minimize risk by releasing the funds every two weeks allowing time for assessments, and if needed, the re-balancing of rewards for underperforming pools. \n\nThe multisig will be managed by: \n\n- 3 Evmos DAO Governance members (Benny Lava, Tricky, LPX)\n- 1 Diffusion team member (mercenaryApe)\n- 1 Validator (Swiss Staking)\n\n## Incentives Allocations \n\nThe EVMOS incentives will go towards attracting liquidity for EVMOS pairs with ATOM, WETH, WBTC, OSMO, JUNO, DIFF, and USDC pools. The EVMOS token incentive breakdown for those pools would be as follows:\n\n**Category: Major (50%)**\n\n- EVMOS / ATOM - 400k \n- EVMOS / wETH - 400k (200k each Axelar, Celer) \n- EVMOS / wBTC - 200k (66.7K each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\n\n**Category: Stablecoins (35%)**\n\n- EVMOS / Stablecoins - 700k (USDC split evenly between Axelar and Celer -- USDT and DAI for Gravity Bridge)\n\n**Category: Minor (15%)**\n\n- EVMOS / OSMO - 100k \n- EVMOS / JUNO - 100k \n- EVMOS / DIFF - 100k \n\nFor the kickoff program, we propose the equal distribution of incentives between the bridged assets **with the exception of gUSDC and gWETH pools**, as they are already being incentivized and are locked into smart contracts for the time being. This distribution will take course over a 90 day period.\n\n**Rebalancing of Pool Allocations** - Over the first 14 days funds will be split evenly between pools in each category, followed by distribution proportionate to each pool's TVL \u0026 Volume accordingly. 50% of the category incentives based upon TVL, and 50% based upon volume to fairly distribute incentives to the most valuable pools.\n\nRough TVL and APR targets per pool: [Graphical Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16395727/192321522-df012984-1edf-4a39-b9df-b3d959a532c5.png) \n\n## Future Plans \n\nFuture proposals can use this data to gauge their own bridge incentives. This will help the most desired liquidity continue to come onto Evmos and maintain attractive APRs while doing so. We are currently aiming to hit a TVL of $20mil on Evmos by the end of the year (across the entire network).\n\n2mil EVMOS is less than 1.5% of our available funds, and covers an entire DEX including interchain assets on Evmos. When compared to the 0.5% spent for a single EVMOS/OSMO pool, we firmly believe that this kickoff initiative is reasonable. We are currently working on a standardized framework in which these processes can be streamlined and more transparent; we thank the community for your patience and thank you to all those that have participated in the discussion stage of the proposal.\n\n**About Diffusion:**\n\nDiffusion is the a Uniswap v2 fork with Sushi's MinichefV2 implemented for rewards distribution. Diffusion was the first DEX and by far the largest in TVL and volume before the Nomad hack. With stablecoins back on Evmos and incentives to give them a boost, the revitalized team will soon be releasing a new roadmap and their plans to continually improve the DEX.\n\n---\n\n**Meta**\n\nIPFS: https://bafybeiftslqvljku5szkumbeoy3s2fje5j56xio5mwydxpxbnajcvunpwa.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-PS-1.md \nMultisig: [0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09) (evmos1xhpr0w43nedcjuy0s5fmwhls7parc2sfs33xef)",

        "description": "###\n# INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n\n**ChainHub \u0026 Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community and, post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\n\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is the faculty sponsor and founding faculty advisor of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\n\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n\n#### OUR EXPERIENCE\n\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\n\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n\n#### SUMMARY OF TERMS\n\n1. ChainHub will:\n  \n      a. Incubate approximately[^1] two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n  \n      b. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\n\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n\n#### BUDGET REQUEST\n\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\n\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\n1. The first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (310559 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3. The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 625K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 100K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 125K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\n\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 2 Web3 + backend engineers, 1 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe initial 500K worth of Evmos token will be used to fund development to reach the funding milestones. These tokens and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. We will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 50K a month in conversion to USD. The remaining 500K worth of Evmos will be staked until their corresponding development milestones are reached. \n\nA multisig will be set up to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\n#### MULTISIG COMPOSITION\nThe multisig composition is 3/5. The signers are as follows:\n- Loredana | The Laurel Project\n- Liam | Tharsis\n- Tricky | EvmosDAO\n- Outcast | Legion Validators\n- Chainhub\n\n#### PROPOSED PROJECTS\n\n1. **EvLend**\n\nProject Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s)\n\nEvLend aims to be the most efficient variable rate borrow-lend market on Evmos.\n\nEvLend uses reactive interest rate technology to target specific utilization rates (% of funds in the money market being borrowed) for stablecoin assets while still providing support for borrow \u0026 lend services to other assets.\n\nReactive interest rates are a more recent innovation popularized by Euler finance. EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.\n\nEvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.\n\nThe lead developer for EvLend is Max Feldman.\n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8) \n\nMore information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.\n\n2. **Evmos Bridge**\n\nProject Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox)\n\nWe propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning. Additionally, we will build the cross-chain protocol leveraging a battle tested security and consensus model that is as secure as the economic security of the blockchains it is built upon.\n\nWith the minimal bridge paths available today, Evmos will continue to struggle with onboarding users and value into the ecosystem.\n\nProviding routes for users to bridge from the most popular DeFi hubs streamlines the process to onboard value into Evmos by orders of magnitude. By the end of Q3 2023 we plan on having Evmos, Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism integrated into the network.\n\nAdditionally, Chainhub will be resposible for running and maintaining the required validators for the liquidity network while this contract is active.\n\nThe lead developer for Evmos Bridge is Thad Hutcheson: \n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk)\n\nFor more information regarding the specifications of the bridge please refer to the documentation or reach back out to us for any further questions.\n\n[^1]: We say \"approximate\" as we may not converge on two projects, or may converge on more than two per year. Our goal will remain to incubate at least two per year.",

        "description": "## INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to extend the external EVMOS incentives for the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis. 600,000 EVMOS will be distributed to 14 day bonding only over 90 days. The total ask is for 600,100 EVMOS to also cover the external incentives gauge fees. The funds will be sent to a 3/4 multisig upon approval to deploy the incentives on Osmosis. You can find the commonwealth discussion here: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives)\n\n **Motivation**\n\nWe have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M. Deep \u0026 stable liquidity is important for the health of every protocol, and incentives can play a key part in maintaining this liquidity. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th, so the community needs to decide the next steps forward.\n\n **Plan of Action**\n\n Based on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, we are asking to extend incentives on Osmosis with another 600k EVMOS over 90 days. Osmosis is the gateway for new users into the Cosmos ecosystem so it is important to maintain deep liquidity. Once this period is over, we can reevaluate the incentives as we will have a clearer picture with how native liquidity has grown.\n\n600k EVMOS over a 90 day period (6,666.67 EVMOS per day), 100 EVMOS for funding Osmosis gauge creation and filling.\n\nTOTAL : 600,100 EVMOS\n\n14 day bond only\n\nPool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\n\n **MULTISIG (3/4)**\n\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\n\nbennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nTricky | Cosmos Spaces - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nLPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nJohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs",

        "description": "## Author\nGV | Swiss Staking ([@swiss_staking](https://twitter.com/swiss_staking))\n## Intro \nThe [Diffusion](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/64) incentives will start soon. As you might know, some incentivized pools require to bridge assets from Ethereum via Axelar/Gravity to Evmos. Once they are bridged to Evmos, you must convert them (on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) of Evmos) from IBC-coins to ERC-20 tokens. This requires a fee of about ~0.3 Evmos. New ecosystem participants won’t own any Evmos at this time, so it is crucial to implement a faucet who funds them. This situation is only temporary, as the team will implement an auto-conversion on protocol level in the near future. Until then, it’s our job to onboard new participants with ease to unleash the full potential of the DeFi revival on Evmos.\n## Architecture \nThe bot will be available on the Discord faucet channel of Evmos. To minimize any gaming of the faucet we will implement a cooldown period, a minimum number of assets that must be deposited on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) and further on-chain checks. The bot's wallet will be funded by the multisig on a bi-weekly basis (or if the balance gets close to zero). Furthermore, we might fund additional hot-wallets for faucet purposes.\n## Funds \nOnboarding 20,000 users is a likely scenario thus we ask for 6,000 Evmos to be used for dust. Unused Evmos will be returned within 6 months. Code refactoring, integration and management of the bot is volunteer effort. \n## Gnosis Safe (Multisig)\nAddress: evmos1clc75pp4sqx4kus3r79uq88d08vc25dkq6483h, 2/4 confirmation: \n- GV | Swiss Staking \n- Dev_D (mod)\n- Benny (mod / gov ws)\n- Sigmung | Qubelabs\n## Commonwealth\nThis proposal was discussed on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7208-faucet-for-defi-kickoff)",

For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nThe purpose of this release is to return funds to the affected accounts during the claims records clawback of block 5074187. This process will be done through the upgrade handler. This will have to be a coordinated (breaking) upgrade since the state will be modified.\\n\\nThe list of affected accounts can be found at app/upgrades/v9_1/accounts.go with their respective balance. The scripts used to find affected accounts were made public at [claims_fixer's](https://github.com/evmos/claims_fixer) repo with detailed instructions on how to run them and reproduce the same result.\\n\\nNOTE: The return of funds to affected accounts is only relevant to Mainnet.\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created a End-to-End testing suite that perfoms the software upgrade locally. These tests have been performed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).",

        "description": "**Summary**\n\nDystopia Labs is requesting $75k (60,000 EVMOS at time of writing) from the Evmos community to support 5 IRL events for $15k each, totaling to $75k in 2023:\n\n- ETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n- DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n- ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n- ETH Seattle (July 2023)\n- ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWho Are We:\n\nDear Evmos Community,\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder \u0026 CEO of Dystopia Labs [http://dystopialabs.com](http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, \u0026 more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:\n\n• ETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n• DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n• ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n• ETH Seattle (July 2023)\n• ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.\nWe expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\nTo us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\nIn the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\nOther sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n**WHY THE CONFERENCES ARE VALUABLE TO EVMOS:**\n\nBeyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.\n\nWe’re Part Of The Ecosystem:\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF \u0026 DeFi Bogota. As a summary, here are the key stats for the 2 events Evmos participated in:\n\nFor DeFi Bogota: [(https://2022.defibogota.org/](https://2022.defibogota.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 2024 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~700 attendees\n• 20 speakers\n• 21 sessions\n• 18 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 2 workshops\n• 7 hrs of content\n\nFor Hacksummit SF: [https://sf.hacksummit.org](https://sf.hacksummit.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 916 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~350 attendees\n• 30 sessions\n• 24 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 5 workshops\n• 10 hrs of content",

        "description": "**Summary**\n\nThe Galxe team proposes allocating $400K USD in EVMOS to fund targeted campaigns and initiatives that provides Evmos with exposure to new users and drives organic growth on-chain. Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so. These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well. With a large portion of the Rektdrop being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.\n\n2/3 Multisig members:\nLPX - EvmosDAO\nGV | Swiss staking - EvmosDAO\nMat - Galxe Team\n\nMultisig address:\n0x0d5BCc86Feb4c26e17D672e57775Ae80C5597932\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nGalxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users. Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)\n\nDiffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:\n\n● Following socials (Twitter/Discord)\n● Retweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet\n● Make a swap\n● Provide liquidity\n● Buy an NFT and hold for X amount of time\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n● Introduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses to the Evmos ecosystem\n● Introduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing power: Joint AMA’s, Blog post, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Campaign featured on our main carousel see: [https://galxe.com/campaigns](https://galxe.com/campaigns).\n● Engage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem\n● Educate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nGalxe is requesting a rewards pool of $400k USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members. We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign. Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.\n\n [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe)",

        "title": "[ECP-1] Formalizing the Foundational Layer of Evmos DAO Governance",
        "description": "**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Notice:** This proposal submission has been significantly shortened to fit within the proposal word count and accompanying graphical content has been removed - we highly recommend reading the full version on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md).\n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified Guiding Values. Each proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. After a month of deliberation and productive discussions on Commonwealth, we feel confident to move forward.\n\nThe scope of this vote is to formalize ECP-1, which includes two submodules:\n- ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n- ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework\n---\nThe rest of the following proposals will be presented to the community very shortly:\n\n- ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod \u0026 Support Workstream\n- ECP-3: Empowering the Community with Strategic Growth Initiatives*\n- ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n---\n**ECP-2A will be submitted for voting later tonight, with ECP-2B to follow within the week.**\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 will be finalized and proposed in Q1 2023, but the proposal drafts are available for preview on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-3.md).**\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos core team is becoming harder to manage.\n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years.\n## ECP-1A: Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework. All community proposals must go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the framework before going on-chain for voting.\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAOs Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams. The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n## ECP Framework Components\n### 1. Definitions of the ECP Framework\n### 2. The ECP Lifecycle \n**Phase 1: Discussion \u0026 Ideation | Min. 48 hours | Forum Tag: [IDEATION]**\n**Phase 2: ECP Formalization | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: [PRE-PROPOSAL]**\n**Phase 3: ECP Signaling (Temp. Check) | Min. 72 hours | Forum Tag: [PROPOSAL]**\n**Phase 4: On-Chain Voting | Forum Tag: [VOTING]**\n### 3. ECP Standards and Templates\n### 4. ECP Submission Guidelines\nPlease refer to [Full Proposal \u003e](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)\n---\n## ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in scaling a DAO and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations. One of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. Please refer to full proposal for our vision for workstreams.\n### 1. Definition and Purpose \nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation \u0026 Support, Marketing \u0026 Creative Services, etc). A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives.\n### 2. Workstream Requirements \nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered informal. A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the various creation.\n### 3. Workstream Formation Process\n### 4. Workstream Stages\n\n## The Standardized Compensation Framework\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n**Compensation Principles, Compensation Types, Compensation Eligibility** can be found in the full document.\n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment \n- The monthly compensation amount \n- Compensation rationale (base and vested) \n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members. This framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders \u0026 the DAO. \n\n## Base Compensation\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Value Level** - refers to the contributors expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributors level. Value Level Assessment Matrix - Please refer to the full proposal.\n\n**2 | Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks for a total of 160 hours / month. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: refer to the full proposal.\n\n**3 | Base Rate** - The base rate is currently proposed at $28/hr. The Community may vote to adjust the hourly rate through a governance proposal to account for changes in market conditions and/or treasury reserve levels. \n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**:\n `Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n## Vesting Compensation\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Contribution Level** - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nRefer to full prop for more details.\n\n**2 | Accountability Level** - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2. \n\nPlease refer to the full proposal to view the accountability level table.\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**:\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\nVesting schedules for all contracts are 4-years.\n\n[Full Proposal \u003e](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)"

My work is proven by [GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea) and [my technical demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos). I am an early investor in Evmos, representing a volunteer organization. And I manage the evmos4volunteers validator.\n\nI invested all my energy and skills to make Evmos better and showing others what it can do, since February 2022.\n\n## An Independent Evmos Chain\n\nI want to see Evmos DAO as a body that fully implements the independence of Evmos:\n- the Evmos Community cannot be rug pulled by unknown dues from just a couple of actors.\n- the investors of Evmos (those who brought value and raised the price of Evmos for everyone's benefit) and the contributors of effort to Evmos have a strong say in the governance of Evmos \n- the Evmos DAO does not have hidden influences from any 3rd party\n- the Evmos DAO is subservient to the Evmos Chain\n- the Evmos DAO bodies have a mechanism of checks and balances that will disincentivize corrupt practices\n\n## The ECP-x Proposals - Issues\n\nLooking at proposal https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83 and [the subsequent proposals in plan](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) by the same group (led by LPX, Bennylava, GV), the issues are:\n- the authors baked their names in the formation of the organization\n- all operations of their organization have not been public\n- they started filling out roles before the organization was ratified on-chain\n- they dismissed other competing ideas for Evmos DAO that were already presented\n- they don't accept improvements to their text if you tell them what is wrong\n- they already have bigger powers in the Evmos Discord than any other validator or investor, even in their unofficial capacity, and they can focus the attention of voters and validators on topics that they want\n- their real identities are not known to the Evmos Community\n- they have no supervisor to hold them accountable. The Evmos Community cannot do that, because their operations are not public\n- I have been contributing as a volunteer to Evmos from before its genesis but I (nor others who contributed to Evmos governance) was not invited by this group to join this governance workstream. So, it is not merit that earns you a position in their governance workstream.\n- their relationship with Tharsis and Evmos Foundation is unclear. If they have formed this group and given them the above powers, then there is no Evmos Community in the Evmos DAO, and between the voting power of the core team, VC validators, foundation delegations promises, a controlled governance process, there is no chain independence.\n- their texts for Evmos DAO are very long, lack substance, and are evasive. Formation texts need to be precise.\n- the erosion of Governance (as we know it in Cosmos):\n    - [ECP-2A]/Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing \u0026 Planned)/B. Off-Chain Community Governance (In Progress) has conflicts of control: what happens when the Cosmos side votes YES on a proposal and the EVM side votes NO on the same proposal? (These types of problems have been solved by my quasar solution.)\n    - [ECP-3] talks about $GOV as governance token. It is unclear from the document what role this has in the actual Governance process. This is intentionally evasive. \n\n\n## Solutions: An Honest DAO\n\n1. Read the alternative texts: [A Vision for Evmos: Proven Independency](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7846-a-vision-for-evmos-proven-independency)\n2. Decide how to vote: either vote YES to proposal #83 and their other ECP-x proposals or vote NO and wait for the above alternative to be proposed on-chain.\n\n- my alternative Evmos DAO does not propose anybody in any official position\n- subsequent proposals will prove and guarantee Evmos chain independence from past dues and any occult forces but lay out in the open the deserved influence that Evmos founders and important proven contributors should have\n- I will not ask for retroactive pay for my services, like the authors of #83 plan. Nor should the chain accept to pay for services that were not solicited. My proposal for this: [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)\n- the quasar technology (cosmos sdk \u003c-\u003e EVM communication) that I invented (and demoed) will be able to bring flexible governance on-chain, to the token holders. Such as the ability to choose one option from many and add new options during voting, or continuous voting. E.g. the chain directly and continuously decides on Evmos DAO bodies, offices, and their members.\n\n## Discussion\n\n- [A Vision for Evmos: Proven Independency](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7846-a-vision-for-evmos-proven-independency)\n- [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)\n- [Evmos DAO creation discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7782-evmos-dao-creation-discussion)\n- [Repayment of effort for Informal Evmos Governance Workstream](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7841-repayment-of-effort-for-informal-evmos-governance-workstream)\n\n## How to vote on this proposal\n\nFirst, I apologize for putting this as an urgent proposal, without prior discussion (even though my listed commonwealth proposals \u0026 criticism have much more than the required 3 days of pre-chain discussions). I was forced by circumstance: proposal #83 being put on-chain before chain independence of dues has been achieved.\n\nThis proposal is for bringing the dialogue on-chain when the dialogue off-chain is evaded.\n\nWe let the Evmos Community know that there are alternatives to the present Evmos DAO proposals. If you want to keep the Evmos chain independent and decentralized, you want to know them before voting on #83.\n\nVox Catenae Vox Dei.\n"

        "description": "## Authors\n\n - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n## Summary\n[ECP-2A](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html) is the follow-up proposal of [ECP-1](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md), which set the foundational layer for Evmos DAO Governance ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO (Proposal #51), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past six months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n### Important Notice\n\nThis post has been modified to fit within the maximum allowed character count.\n\n- [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (GitHub)](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (HTML)](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)\n## Abstract\n### Foreword\nThe overwhelming community support and the shared beliefs in our vision have been truly inspiring. The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)\n### The Governance Council\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.\n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and even replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\nGet familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).\n## Funding Request\nWe recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).\n\n- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS\n- **B. Research \u0026 Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **D. Treasury Diversification \u0026 Future WS Comps:** 1,560,000 EVMOS\n- **Total:** 4,743,668 EVMOS (~790,611 EVMOS / month, ~4.2% of CommunityPool)\n\nWe are currently in talks with a few Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams via a token-for-stable swap. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our operational runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market.\n\nA more detailed itemized list of requested funds can be found in the full proposal as well as the the Litepaper.\n### Fund Disbursements\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury - Phase 1\" which is managed by 3 Council Members and 3 Active Validators in a 4-6 Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending is publicly available for viewing with full transparency.\n\n**Fund Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223)\n(evmos1670l07l2533t0w9tvd529uaz20majs3rf57zgz)\n\n**DAO Treasury - Phase 2** will be implemented when ready. This change in Treasury Management will mean funds will need to pass off-chain spending proposals as shown in the Litepaper.\n\n👉 [ECP-2A: Full Proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md)\n\n👉 [ECP-2A: Full Proposal HTML Version](https://www.evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)\n\n👉 [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper)",
